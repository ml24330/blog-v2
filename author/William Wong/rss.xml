	     <p><strong>Case Note: <em>Darnley v Croydon Health Service NHS Trust [2018] UKSC 50, [2018] 3 WLR 1153</em></strong></p>

<h5 id="a-introduction1">A. Introduction<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></h5>

<p><em>Darnley v Croydon Health Service NHS Trust</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> (‘<strong><em>Darnley</em></strong>’) deals with the deceptively simple trio of negligence – duty of care, breach, and causation. In recent years, some judges have conflated them in a composite assessment by over-specifying the content of duty of care. In this refreshingly succinct judgment, the Supreme Court (‘<strong>UKSC</strong>’) gave a principled analysis of the nature of these components and preferred a more systematic and compartmentalised approach.</p>

<h5 id="b-brief-facts">B. Brief Facts</h5>

<p>The Appellant attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Mayday Hospital, Croydon.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a>  Despite having indicated to the receptionist that he had a head injury required urgent attention, he was told of a waiting time of 4 to 5 hours. In fact, the hospital’s policy would require a nurse to attend to the Appellant within 30 minutes. <a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> After waiting for 19 minutes, he decided to leave. Later, he felt increasingly unwell and was taken back to the same hospital by an ambulance. It was revealed that he suffered from a extradural haematoma with a marked midline shift.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> The Appellant eventually suffered permanent brain damage.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a></p>

<p>The Appellant claimed against the Respondent for a negligence, that the reception staff gave wrong information about the time he would have to wait, and its failure to assess the Appellant for priority triage. The claim was dismissed by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal (‘<strong>CA</strong>’) dismissed the appeal (McCombe LJ dissenting), holding that none of the duty, breach, and causation requirements were met. The UKSC allowed the appeal.</p>

<h5 id="c-analysis">C. Analysis</h5>

<h6 id="i-incremental-approach-affirmed"><u>i. Incremental approach affirmed</u></h6>

<p><em>Darnley</em> is consistent with the UKSC’s recent restatement in <em>Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> (‘<strong>Robinson</strong>’), that it is unnecessary to consider the <em>Caparo</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> ‘fair, just, and reasonable’ (‘<strong>FJR</strong>’) test so long as the case falls under a pre-existing category where a duty of care could arise. Lord Lloyd-Jones did not even feel the need to review fully the existing authorities, since relying on Lord Reed’s exposition in <em>Robinson</em> seems to suffice. Common to both cases is a reluctance, almost distaste, for the FJR test. This reaffirms that the UKSC is honouring its promise to abandon the search of an one-size-fits-all test based on a unifying principle. With a category established in the case law, it is effectively presumed to be ‘fair, just, and reasonable’. The courts will no longer ‘re-open’ the category for scrutiny. The problem, however, is its presupposition that the previous cases are correctly decided and devoid of problems. Such presumption might deny the Courts the freedom to revisit some anomalous categories should the opportunity arise. In fact, <em>Caparo</em>’s ‘incremental approach’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> which was approved by the UKSC in <em>Darnley</em>, is nothing novel nor commendable - the very mode of common law reasoning embraces analogy and incrementalism. Nevertheless, certainty triumphs over the search for principle here.</p>

<p>As a matter of precedent, no case law has specifically touched upon whether a receptionist in a hospital owns a duty of care towards prospective patients. With a note of pragmatism, the Court acknowledged that not very precise factual situation will have been the subject of a reported judicial decision. The ‘previously established category’ that the Court had in mind is that ‘those who provide and run a casualty department to persons presenting themselves complaining of illness or injury and before they are treated or received into care in the hospital’s wards.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> This means that before resorting to the <em>Caparo</em> test. it is necessary to analyse the case law at a high level of conceptual abstraction.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> But at what level of specification should it be conceptualised is not expressly dealt with.</p>

<p>However, the Court’s finding that it is unnecessary to distinguish between medical and administrative staff is more dubious.  Lord Lloyd-Jones asserted that the receptionist is tasked with the responsibility to ‘provide accurate information as to [medical assistance]’s availability’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> He feels that the distinction is only relevant to the question of breach. This is going arguably too far because in ascertaining duty of care, the focus is commonlly placed on factors such as an individual’s status and expertise relatively to that of the claimant. A more convincing way of putting it is to adopt the analysis in <em>Macaulay v Karim and Croydon Health Services NHS Trust</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> which similarly concerned misinformation given by a receptionist. Foskett J classified the events as a ‘system failure’, instead of attributing the breach to a particular individual.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Whilst this has the virtue of differentiating different members of staff in painstaking details, difficult questions of attribution can arise in determining which acts or omissions constitute the system failure, smacking of artificiality.</p>

<p>In sum, the UKSC is largely reiterating the orthodoxy in applying the incremental test, while reducing the need to resort to the FJR scrutiny.</p>

<h6 id="ii-eliding-duty-and-breach"><u>ii. Eliding duty and breach</u></h6>

<p>To properly understand this one has to return to the very foundation of the notion of ‘duty’. Hohfeld sees ‘duty’ and ‘right’ as jural correlatives in a relationship between two given individuals.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> In the language of tort law, it is commonplace to describe that ‘A owed B a duty of care’. The ‘duty’ narrative at first sight focuses on the status of the individuals. Therefore we speak of solicitor-client, doctor-patient, and parent-child as ‘established categories of relationships where duty of care arises’. However, Lord Bridge sounded a note of caution in <em>Caparo</em>:</p>

<p>‘It is never sufficient simply to ask whether A owes B a duty of care. It is always necessary to determine the scope of the duty by reference to the kind of damage from which A must take care to hold B harmless.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a></p>

<p>Lord Bridge requires identification of the <em>precise harm</em> that A is required to undertake one’s duty to prevent B from being affected. It is the <em>extent of specification</em> that concerns us here. In this regard, Goudkamp saw the CA judgment in <em>Darnley</em> as eroding of the customary divide between the duty of care and breach elements in negligence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> For instance, Sales LJ framed the ‘duty question’ as whether there is a duty to provide ‘precise and accurate information’ about the length of time before a patient might be seen by a triage nurse.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> This, in the UKSC’s view, goes to the question of seriousness of breach only.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a></p>

<p>Conflating these two components is not an isolated mistake, but instead reflects a systematic problem ringing throughout tort law. In <em>Sam v Atkins</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> May LJ made a particularly bold statement. He acknowledged that it is customary to examine in a compartmental manner duty of care, breach, causation and damage; but that is ‘technically wrong’ since negligence is a ‘composite’ concept.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> In <em>S v Gloucestershire County Council</em>, he further opined that the duty of care question ‘necessarily subsumes the question whether the acts or omissions of the defendant caused the damage relied on’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> Even Lord Diplock in the seminal case of <em>Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> has fallen prey to this. He framed the enquiry question in a detailed manner: whether ‘any duty of care to prevent the escape of a Borstal trainee from custody’ was owed ‘by the Home Office to persons whose property would be likely to be damaged by the tortious acts of the Borstal trainee if he escaped’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> This level of graphic details detracts the court from first, analysing the nature of relationship between the Home Office and the property owners in the vicinity; and second, balancing the risk and consequence of escape with the costs of prevention for the ‘breach question’.</p>

<p>Another reason why the Court should not over-specify the duty of care element is that a varied standard can be adopted at the breach stage. Nolan, in a penetrating analysis, has argued that varying the standard is a more useful technique.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> It may well be said that Accident &amp; Emergency departments operate in a high-pressure environment. Lord Lloyd-Jones is therefore perfectly entitled to say that this is an important factor when assessing whether there has been a negligent breach of duty. This is precisely where the law could make allowance for and depart cautiously from the stringent ‘objective’ standard.</p>

<h6 id="iii-conflation-with-other-components---causation-and-defence"><u>iii. Conflation with other components - causation and defence</u></h6>

<p>This wide understanding of duty of care not only bears the risk of confusion with the breach assessment, it also subsumes the discussion that should arise under causation and defence. In <em>Darnley</em>, the CA further conflated the duty question with that of causation. Jackson LJ held that the scope of the duty would not extend to ‘liability for the consequences of a patient walking out without telling the staff that he was about to leave’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> The UKSC found that no chain of causation has been broken simply because the Appellant decided to leave. It was reasonably foreseeable and was made partly on the basis of the misleading information.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a></p>

<p>Similarly, in <em>Rees v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> police owed the deceased a duty to take reasonable care to prevent him from committing suicide. As Nolan observed, framing the duty of care in this manner effectively subsumed causation (<em>novus actus interveniens</em>) and defence (<em>volenti non fit iniuria</em>). Similar problems are observed in the statutory context for occupiers’ liability.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 enables the court to determine whether an occupier owes a duty to a person (other than a visitor) through considering knowledge, foresight, and obviousness of danger,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> which are traditionally the language used in ascertaining the standard of care. The CA’s error in <em>Darnley</em> is thus only emblematic of a greater structural difficulty.</p>

<h6 id="iv-public-policy-and-social-costs"><u>iv. Public policy and social costs</u></h6>

<p>Public policy arguments in negligence actions are commonplace, but the UKSC was blunt to dismiss the Respondent’s arguments on the social cost and potential expenses incurred as ‘misplaced’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> Typical arguments employed by public authorities in negligence claims include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Perverse incentive and defensive behaviour: In <em>Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> fear of defensive policing behaviour. Sales LJ in the CA in <em>Darnley</em> also alluded to this argument, expressing his fear that information will be withdrawal from the public.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> Rejecting this, Lord Lloyd-Jones simply said that the burden of proof lies on the claimant - so long as the staff testifies as to their standard practice, sufficient safeguard would be in place.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> The problem is that this justification surely applies with equal force to the police investigation context in <em>Hill</em>. In any event, A &amp; E departments and serious crime investigation are both high-pressure environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Floodgate’ argument: Jackson LJ in the CA judgment was concerned that a fertile ground for litigation would ensue.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Nevertheless, Lord Lloyd-Jones did not address this claim head-on. It is perhaps the specific factual circumstances of the case that led him to believe there would not be a large amount of ensuing claims.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the Court in <em>Darnley</em> seems hasty in dismissing these considerations. The policy arguments are not foreign – they have been extensively rehearsed as ‘stock arguments’ and are almost becoming cliché.  It is in the interest of judicial candour that the UKSC be forthright in addressing them. In <em>Robinson</em>, Lord Hughes admirably acknowledged policy concerns as the ‘ultimate reason’ why no duty is imposed on the police.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> Nevertheless, Lord Reed countered that policy should not be routinely considered when existing principles provide a clear basis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> By adhering to Lord Reed’s policy-minimalist approach, <em>Darnley</em> managed to shield itself from allegations of judicial overreach and activism. This is understandable when the policy issues were not decisive in the present case.</p>

<h5 id="d-conclusion">D. Conclusion</h5>

<p><em>Robinson</em>, with <em>Darnley</em> as its latest reaffirmation, has for now largely settled the approach towards assessing public authority’s duty of care. Ultimately, it is the ‘malleability’ of duty enquiry that generates incoherence in negligence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> It is plausible that such malleability was the culprit in the courts’ abandonment of the search for unifying principle, which in turn gives rise to rule-of-law concern due to its opaqueness. In sum, <em>Darnley</em>’s note of caution against conflating the two stages of assessment is reassuring and laudable.</p>

	     <h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>

<p>What is more exciting than a legal tirade between two of the most prominent English judges? Contractual interpretation is the bread-and-butter work of the commercial courts. Whilst it does not attract huge attention in an undergraduate contract law syllabus, its paramount importance in commercial contracting certainly deserves the ink spilled by the duo. In an annual lecture, Lord Sumption revisited the age-old debate on the proper approach to contractual interpretation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> This was soon greeted with fierce criticism by Lord Hoffmann in a Law Quarterly Review article.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> I will present their arguments, and examine how successful the attempt at reconciliation has been.</p>

<h5 id="a-little-bit-of-history">A little bit of history</h5>

<p>To understand the debate properly, one has to travel briefly back into history. Under a traditional textual analysis, the courts regarded the ‘natural and ordinary’ or ‘plain’ meaning of contractual words as almost conclusive, together with the use of dated canons of constructions. Contractual meaning is to be found within the ‘four corners’ of the document.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> In <em>ICS v West Bromwich BS,</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Lord Hoffmann sweepingly discarded what he called the ‘old intellectual baggage of contractual interpretation’ and reformulated them into five principles.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> Broadly summarized, two points stand out. First, courts will seek a ‘common sense’ interpretation considering what an ordinary reasonable person would understand it to mean. Second, courts will also look at the legal, factual and regulatory surrounding circumstances of the contract in all cases, not just where there is an ambiguity. This extends to, in his own words, ‘absolutely anything’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> This apparent departure from the traditional common law position has gained traction, notably in <em>Chartbrook v Persimmon Homes</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> and <em>Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a>, where an assessment of ‘business common sense’ took centre stage.</p>

<h5 id="the-debate">The debate</h5>

<p>As a keen supporter of a textual approach, Sumption proclaimed that ‘language, properly used, should speak for itself and it usually does’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Sumption criticized Hoffmann for presuming inherent adaptability of all language. He further denounced the belittling of dictionaries and grammars as tools of interpretation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> The overriding theme is that judges are not necessarily well-placed to determine what commercial common sense requires. This sentiment is indeed shared by many academics, who urged courts to recognise the limits and confines of the court’s commercial experience.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Overall, Sumption sees the Supreme Court as withdrawing from the more advanced positions seized during the ‘Hoffmann offensive’, to a more ‘defensible’ position (i.e. more self-restrained approach to interpretation).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Whether this is accurate is examined later.</p>

<p>This is soon greeted by Lord Hoffmann’s LQR article. His remarks are particularly damning - that Lord Sumption is plainly wrong in claiming that words have ‘autonomous meaning’ irrespective of the strength of background evidence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Words have conventional meanings, but one can only understand what they were used to mean if one knows the context. This is a pragmatic approach that recognises the realities of judicial decision-making. It also allows judges to be intellectually honest. Such approach has the virtue of giving effect to parties’ real intention, rather than stretching and truncating it with judicial fictions of irrebuttable presumptions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a></p>

<p>How could we account for the deeply divided opinions? Lord Sumption is well-known for having developed a distinctive judging style that demonstrates his remarkable judicial conservatism.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Conservatism here refers not to political ideology, but a conceptualization of the role of judges and the extent to which a court can interfere in parties’ dealings. It can perhaps be attributed to the fact that the commercial judges, like Lord Sumption, have taken a harder line for the sake of commercial certainty. Equity lawyers, Lord Hoffmann amongst them, are arguably relatively keener to give leeway. The two conflicting approaches are based on wholly different normative policy concerns and understanding of judicial reach that are difficult to be reconciled in a technical manner.</p>

<h5 id="attempt-at-reconciliation">Attempt at reconciliation</h5>

<p>In fact, prior to this Hoffmann-Sumption debate, Lord Hodge had attempted to reconcile the two rival approaches in <em>Wood v Capita Insurance Services</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> that ‘textualism and contextualism are not conflicting paradigms in a battle for exclusive occupation of the field of contractual interpretation’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> However laudable, it is of limited practical significance. First, it does not accord with the attitude in the judicial and academic community, which continues to resemble a pendulum between the paradigms. Second, and more fatally, Lord Hodge’s approach lacks intellectual honesty and does not offer any greater certainty to commercial parties.</p>

<p>Lord Hodge, citing Lord Bingham, rejected the contention that contextualism is a new phenomenon and argued the notion that the court putting itself in the shoes of the contracting parties had a long pedigree.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> On a text/contextualism spectrum, theapproach adopted for construing the contract varies according to the circumstances of the particular agreement. He was at pains to point out that the recent history of contractual interpretation is one of continuity rather than change.</p>

<p>This, however, conveniently overlooks many inconsistencies between <em>ICS</em> and subsequent case law. The conflict was heightened by <em>Arnold v Britton,</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> endorsed by <em>Wood</em> despite sitting uncomfortably with it. <em>Arnold</em> focuses on the natural meaning of the words and appears to take away the emphasis from the wider factual matrix.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> There, Lord Neuberger downplayed the effect of surrounding circumstances. Business common sense should not be used to ‘undervalue’ the importance of the language, and what the parties meant is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. This exhibits a trend towards a more conservative approach to resolve the debate primarily on the basis of textual analysis,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> and reaffirms Lord Sumption’s position. Furthermore, whether Lord Hodge’s view is representative of the judicial attitude is unclear. The Hoffmann-Sumption exchange aside, his exposition was only mentioned in passing in <em>Actavis UK v Eli Lilly</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a>, where Lord Neuberger found those applicable principles ‘tolerably clear’. Thus, <em>Wood</em>’s agenda is still far from being the final word.</p>

<h5 id="continued-divergence">Continued divergence</h5>

<p>It now seems undeniable that the pendulum has swung back to the primacy of plain language, and Sumption’s observation proves accurate. Lord Hodge’s proposition is vigorously contested by Sir Geoffrey Vos. Vos argues that there have surely been ‘sea changes’ as contractual interpretation is now confined to choosing between available meanings of the words - with little scope for judicial adjustment of the language to reflect what the objective person would think the parties have meant (save in the most exceptional circumstances).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> However, Lord Hodge is not without his supporters. Goh argues that the proper debate is not a dichotomy between a textual or contextual analysis, but rather the extent to which the plain meaning rule should be applied.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> However, one would accept that no bright line can be easily drawn. It is also accepted that it is inappropriate to characterise them as two distinct and discrete factors. But the mere fact that it is a sliding scale does not undermine the conceptualisation of the two concepts battling for a bigger share in the field.</p>

<p>Moreover, the retreat is not a mere English phenomenon. New Zealand has recently in <em>Firm PI 1 v Zurich Australian Insurance</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> adopted a greater role for the plain meaning. Similarly, Singapore case law hasdemonstrated waning enthusiasm for the contextual approach.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> However, Lord Hoffmann’s legacy in Hong Kong in <em>Jumbo King v Faithful Properties</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> continues unscathed as his contextual approach was recently endorsed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> These overseas battlefields signify that the debate continues to be conceptualised in polarised terms with multi-jurisdictional implications.</p>

<p>The difficulty ultimately boils down to an irresistible urge to reformulate again and again the principles. Jackson put it most aptly, ‘every formulation of the rules or principles is coloured by the case which is then before the court. The judge has a sense of what the right answer is and tends to slant his/her general propositions towards reaching that answer.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> This realist perspective has much to commend. Practitioners and contracting parties are now left in bewilderment after plowing through a multitude of expositions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> It might be said that courts are afforded considerable flexibility, but masking the actual retreat only serves to create uncertainty for businesses, not least when contractual construction is the staple for the Commercial Court. Lawyers have already been flooded by various attempts at enumerating lists of interpretative principles. It is foreseeable that, for the time being, the UKSC will refrain from further reformulation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> Lord Hodge’s attempt at reconciling the prior authorities, unfortunately, fails to add clarity to the law, but merely masks the reality of judicial interpretation.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>At the end of the day, Hoffmann and Sumption’s strongly-worded exchange seems to support a criticism of the optimistic <em>Wood</em> decision - that a palpable change in the law and deeply divided approaches has been repeatedly played down. The status quo seems to lean in favour of Sumption’s conclusion. For the sake of commercial certainty, English judges should resist the temptation of another grand reformulation of principles. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the academic debate will continue. Now, all eyes are on Lord Sumption’s Reith lectures on BBC Radio 4 this spring for another comeback.</p>

	     <p><strong>Case note: <em>Regency Villas Title Ltd v Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd</em> [2018] UKSC 57</strong></p>

<h5 id="a-introduction">A. Introduction</h5>

<p>The law of easement, a seemingly dry and technical aspect of land law, has been rejuvenated in the recent UKSC case of <em>Regency Villas Title Ltd v Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> Much of the confusion surrounding the law is attributed to the archaic language of the Re Ellenborough Park test. The present case turns on whether the right to the free use of sporting and recreational facilities provided in a country club may be conferred upon the owners of an adjacent timeshare complex by easements. In doing so, the Court revisited and shed new lights on the classic four-limb test. This note analyses the majority’s reasoning. While recognising its laudable objectives, it then argues that Lord Carnwath’s orthodox approach is sounder in principle and policy.</p>

<h5 id="b-background-facts">B. Background facts</h5>

<p>The case concerns Broome Park, a country estate in Canterbury that includes the ‘Mansion House’, ‘Elham House’ and neighbouring lands. In 1967, Elham House was sold and the seller retained the rest of Broome Park. Following subsequent transfers, Elham House was eventually held for the benefit of the Regency Villas Owners Club’s members. A freehold owner of Elham House, Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd, sought a declaration for the use of the facilities under an easement on the basis of a Facilities Grant. The alleged servient tenement contains a clubhouse and recreational facilities, including a golf course, swimming pool, and gardens. Before the trial judge, the Respondents successfully established the easement. They were granted an injunction restraining interference with their use of the facilities. The Court of Appeal subsequently upheld the decision. The UKSC again dismissed the appeal (Lord Briggs delivering the judgment) and affirmed the existence of such easement.</p>

<h5 id="c-analysis-of-the-majority-opinion">C. Analysis of the majority opinion</h5>

<p>Any discussion of easement invariably starts with In <em>re Ellenborough Park</em>’s adoption of Dr Cheshire’s formulation on the essential conditions: i) There must be a dominant and a servient tenement; ii) The easement must accommodate the dominant tenement; iii) The dominant and servient owners must be different persons; iv) A right over land cannot amount to an easement, unless it is capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant. Since then, this framework has stood for the <em>locus classicus</em>. The present case turns on the scope of the second and fourth condition.</p>

<h6 id="the-accommodation-requirement"><u>The 'Accommodation' requirement</u></h6>
<p>Lord Briggs’ discussion on the ‘accommodation’ requirement seems entirely conventional. Some general principles can be teased out. It is trite that the right must not be merely appurtenant or annexed to the dominant tenement, if the enjoyment has nothing to do with its normal use.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> The ‘normal use’ of the dominant tenement may be residential or business in nature.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> The <em>Re Ellenborough Park</em> formula focuses on benefits that pertain to the land, rooted in the Roman law doctrine of <em>ius spatiandi</em>. Understandably, this seeks to maintain a clear dividing line between mere rights in <em>personam</em> (e.g. licences) from rights in rem. Difficulties abound for recreational rights since they are invariably enjoyed for one’s own sake. They do not pertain to the beneficial use of the dominant tenement – it is nonsensical to say that the land ‘enjoys’ these entertainment facilities. Lord Briggs considers <em>Re Ellenborough Park</em> as dispositive on the issue that recreational use is not fatal to the recognition of a right as an easement, despite previous conflicting dicta.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> This is not a controversial statement – the crux of the dispute falls on how far could the notion of ‘recreational use’ be stretched. Lord Briggs skillfully evaded the ‘extent’ question at this stage of analysis, but chose to address it under the fourth condition.</p>

<h6 id="rights-capable-of-forming-the-subject-matter-of-a-grant"><u>Rights capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant</u></h6>
<p>This requirement is notorious for creating uncertainties with its circular nature. One of its core facets is that the servient owner shall not be obliged to do anything beyond mere passivity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> The Law Commission in 2011 opined that the scope for litigation this created sufficiently outweighs its utility – abolition is overdue.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> It is particularly difficult to delineate precisely when the right is so extensive as to ‘oust’ the servient owner from his enjoyment or control. Here, Lord Briggs was quick to dismiss the Appellant’s ouster argument by deferring to the trial judge and the CA’s factual findings. This decision breaks new ground as it broadens the scope of <em>Ellenborough Park</em> in three dimensions:</p>

<p>1.The nature and extent of the recreational and sporting facilities in <em>Regency Villas</em> requires more intensive management.</p>

<p>2.A wider group of dominant owners (timeshare owners and public members) in present in <em>Regency Villas</em>.</p>

<p>3.The cost of managing and maintaining was shared among servient owners in <em>Regency Villas</em> and dominant owners in <em>Ellenborough Park</em> respectively.</p>

<p>In justifying the extension, Lord Briggs invoked the principle that ‘the common law should, as far as possible, accommodate itself to new types of property ownership and new ways of enjoying the use of land.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> This is arguably in line with the recent judicial attitude. In <em>Coventry v Lawrence</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> a right to commit a noise nuisance could amount to an easement, despite being framed in dubious terms as ‘the right to transmit sound waves over land.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> However, this optimism shall not be taken too far. The majority is not oblivious to the countervailing factors. Annexation to a freehold is indeterminate in length whilst a timeshare structure is frequently set up for a limited duration. In Lord Briggs’ words, ‘the rights conferred are likely to burden the servient land long after the leisure complex in question has outlived its natural life.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Furthermore, he even acknowledged that using easement as the conveyancing vehicle for recreational rights as ‘hardly ideal’ in comparison with a leasehold structure. Surprisingly, there was no attempt at all to rebut these arguments. The conclusion was abrupt as he invokes the vague notion that recreational and sporting activity is a beneficial part of modern life that the common law should support.</p>

<h6 id="d-lord-carnwaths-dissent"><u>D. Lord Carnwath's dissent</u></h6>

<p>A brief yet astute dissent came from the former Law Commissioner. He criticises the majority’s reasoning on several grounds. First, doctrinally, the expansion attracts weak support from authorities. The cases cited by Lord Briggs involves nothing more than access to land for the purposes of walking and enjoyment as a garden or park. These, as he rightly observed, are not comparable with the 18-hole golf course.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> It is submitted that while they support the reasoning of <em>Re Ellenborough Park</em>, it would be far-fetched to say they contemplate the creation of a novel proprietary right. Secondly, he draws on the extensive burden imposed on the alleged servient owner. It involved organisation and management of the entire leisure complex, beyond mere maintenance or repair.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> This distinction was heavily downplayed by Sir Geoffrey Vos in the Court of Appeal. A third objection is a ‘floodgate concern’. Stretched to its logical limit, the majority decision is problematic. It could theoretically be applied to cases such as those concerning free access to the rides and attractions in amusement parks, where active management and supervision are indispensable.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a></p>

<h6 id="e-broader-implications"><u>E. Broader implications</u></h6>

<h6 id="public-policy">Public policy</h6>
<p>The broadly framed fourth condition in <em>Ellenborough Park</em> conveys a policy agenda – to ensure the law of easement evolves with societal realities. However, it is already doubtful whether recognizing the ‘recreational’ value of land bears any novelty whatsoever. More fundamentally, the policy concern surely goes in two directions. Another major objective is to prevent haphazard recognitions that could permanently encumber the land by proprietary restrictions. This in turns inhibits the free alienability of land as a valuable commercial commodity. This must also be viewed in light of the lack of statutory basis for the discharge or modification of easements, contrary to that of restrictive covenants. Finally, the majority’s approach also potentially goes against the spirit of the <em>numerus clausus</em> principle, that rights in rem are confined to a finite subset. It might well be said that no new proprietary rights are created – but <em>numerus clausus</em> is not a matter of form, but substance. Creating a new category of easement without a sound statutory or precedential footing is risky.</p>

<h6 id="practical-implications">Practical implications</h6>
<p>The decision would also be of interest to the conveyancing lawyers because the creation of this type of easement could impose onerous obligations on the servient owner. Importantly, it elevates the application of easements from the typical ‘backyard-garden-type’ cases to large-scale property project developments. Caution is therefore advised in drafting the grant documents. Lord Briggs stressed the importance of the following. First, where common intention to confer an easement is manifested, the ‘validation principle’ is applied to give it proper effect.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Secondly, whether the grant was intended to be a single comprehensive right to use facilities as they evolved, or if it is fixed in time.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Thirdly, the presence of express requirement for contribution to the operational costs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> This is particularly so in this case since the construction of the grant was influential and confidence-boosting in the majority’s decision in creating a new type of easement.</p>

<p>Overall, this seemingly technical case encompasses a debate on conflicting policy paradigms. It also epitomizes the confusion arising from the anachronistic formulation of a test that provides scope for disorganized expansion. The sweeping reforms proposed by the Law Commission merit reconsideration to put the law back on principled track.</p>
