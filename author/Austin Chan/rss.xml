	     <h5 id="introduction">Introduction:</h5>

<p>In the case of <em>R(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> the Supreme Court ruled that the Lord Chancellor’s Fee Orders for the Employment Tribunal (ET) and the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) were unlawful because they limited access to justice. This article will first set out the background facts and context behind the appeal. Then, it will highlight the shift in focus away from EU law to the common law in the Supreme Court judgment (“Judgment”). Finally, it will analyse the Judgment and discuss the common law’s potential to protect basic rights.  </p>

<h5 id="background-facts">Background facts:</h5>

<p>Section 42(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (‘2007 Act’) provides that the Lord Chancellor ‘may by order prescribe fees payable in respect of anything dealt with by the First-tier and Upper Tribunals or by an added tribunal.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> An “added tribunal” is defined by Section 42(3) as a tribunal specified in an order made by the Lord Chancellor.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> In 2013, through an order, the ET and EAT were included as added tribunals.</p>

<p>In July 2013, the Lord Chancellor introduced the Fee Order to make provisions for fees to be payable in respect of any claim presented to the ET and EAT. Before the Fee Order was made, access to the ETs, unlike claims in the ordinary courts, could be presented for free. The amount payable varied depending on the type of claim presented and whether it was brought by a single claimant or a group. The two types of claims are split up into “type A” and “type B” respectively. Type A claims require little to no pre-hearing work and are easy and quick to resolve. Meanwhile, type B claims generally involve more judicial time, for example equal pay claims and unfair dismissal claims. As established by the order, the fees for a single claimant was £390 for a “type A” claim and £1,200 for a “type B” claim. In the EAT, fees of £1,600 are payable. Claimants and appellants could only seek remission of fees after satisfying two criteria. First, their disposable capital must be below a specified amount. Second, if this test was satisfied, then the amount of any remission was qualified by the applicant’s gross monthly income. The threshold for access to remission varied depending on certain factors, for example: whether the claimant is single and whether they have children. The only other exception for remission was if the Lord Chancellor was satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances which justified such deviation.</p>

<p>UNISON sought judicial review over the Fee Order scheme on the basis that it unlawfully prevented or restricted access to justice. The claim was first brought on the grounds that the Fee Order was indirectly discriminatory and breached the EU law principles of effectiveness and equivalence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> The Divisional Court dismissed the claim on the basis that the proceedings were premature and lacked sufficient evidence to sustain the challenge.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> The Court of Appeal dismissed the judgment on the grounds that the imposition of a fee would not constitute an interference with the right of effective access to a tribunal under EU law unless it made it impossible in practice to access the tribunal.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> UNISON then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h5 id="a-shift-in-focus">A shift in focus:</h5>

<p>Before discussing the judgment, it is important to point out the shift in focus which the argument took as it proceeded from the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Before the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal, the issue of the Fee Order’s effect on access to justice was challenged on the basis of EU law. Before the Supreme Court, although some reference was made to EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, it was recognized that as part of the UK’s common law constitution, there was a right of access to justice. The shift in focus from EU law to common law in <em>UNISON</em> is an ample reminder that even with rights guaranteed from EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights, the common law remains a source of constitutional rights. When the Human Rights Act was first introduced, the sole focus from the judiciary on the European Convention on Human Rights compromised the common law’s development and ‘left it in the cupboard.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Only recently have judges brought back the common law as a guarantor of basic rights. As Lord Reed illustrated in <em>Osborn v Parole Board,</em> which concerned the right to a fair hearing,one should not ‘suppose that because an issue falls within the ambit of a Convention guarantee, it follows that the legal analysis of the problem should begin and end with Strasbourg case law.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The focus by the Court on the common law was likely deliberate. The Judgment was handed down after the UK voted to leave the European Union and amid political hostility towards the European Convention on Human Rights. It is in this context that the Judgment illuminates the common law’s potential as a guarantor of basic rights.</p>

<h5 id="the-supreme-courts-judgment">The Supreme Court’s judgment:</h5>

<p>In order to determine the extent of the power conferred on the Lord Chancellor by the 2007 Act, the court must consider both the text of the provision and the constitutional principles that underlie the text. Lord Reed noted that there are two important principles in this case to determine whether the Fee Order was unlawful under English law. First, the constitutional right of access to justice. Second, the rule that ‘specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>In English law, the right of access to the courts has been established since Magna Carta: ‘We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Applied to modern contexts, there are many examples where the judiciary has recognized the constitutional right of access to the courts, which can only be curtailed by clear statutory enactment by Parliament. As Lord Diplock remarked in <em>Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd,</em> ‘the due administration of justice requires <em>first</em> that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> In accordance with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, access to the courts should only be impeded through primary legislation from Parliament.</p>

<p>In principle, as Lord Reed noted, it can be justified for the executive to impose fees upon litigants. The imposition of fees is desirable because it transfers away costs from the general taxpayer to those that use the system. Moreover, a price mechanism could incentivise settlement and prevent weak claims from being pursued. However, in the context of the 2007 Act, Parliament did not expressly authorise the prevention of access to the relevant employment tribunals. As such, the fees imposed can only be justified if they do not lead to a <em>real risk</em> that persons will effectively be prevented from having access to justice. The court held that the present fee order imposed by the Lord Chancellor was not justifiable for five reasons. First, the Review Report on the impact of the fee orders concluded that the imposition of fees resulted in a ‘sharp, substantial and sustained fall in the volume of cases.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Second, the court was not comforted by the presence of the Lord Chancellor’s discretionary power of remission or by the statutory scheme. The effects of the Fee Order had occurred despite the existence of both remission avenues. The problems identified through the report and in the proceedings indicated a systemic issue.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Third, for low to middle income households to meet the expenses, they would need to sacrifice ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Fourth, many claims brought in front of the ETs do not seek any financial award. The claims which do seek a financial award are generally quite modest, for example £500 for unlawful deduction of wages. If a litigant had to pay £390 in order to pursue a claim worth £500, they would only sensibly do so if they were virtually certain of success. In practice, there is never a guarantee of success when pursuing a claim. Thus, the onerous fees would ‘render it futile or irrational to bring a claim.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> The evidence before the court suggested that only half of the claimants who succeeded in obtaining an award received payment in full, and around a third received nothing.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Finally, the Lord Chancellor did not set the prices at an optimal level to maximize revenue and failed to consider the public benefits derived from the enforcement of rights before the Employment Tribunals.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> All of the reasons above led to the conclusion that the Fee Orders effectively prevented access to justice and was therefore unlawful. Given that the Fee Order was unlawful under domestic law, the other arguments presented were dealt with very briefly in the judgment. </p>

<h5 id="discussion">Discussion:</h5>

<p>On doctrinal grounds, the Judgment was reached using well-established common law principles of judicial review. The Supreme Court merely applied the test established in <em>Hillingdon</em>: whether the Fee Order was ultra vires depended on whether there was a ‘real risk’ that litigants would effectively be prevented from having access to the court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> When reviewing this judgment, it must be emphasised that in <em>UNISON</em> the primary legislation contained no words authorizing the prevention of access to justice. However, Lord Reed, relying on the cases of <em>Leech</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> and <em>Daly</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> also suggested in obiter that even where primary legislation was concerned, the imposition of an intrusion on the right of access to justice is subject to a presumed implied limitation: the intrusion ‘must not be greater than is justified by the objectives which the measure is intended to serve.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> If this limitation was applied to primary legislation, it would appear to be a radical step in well-established principles of judicial review. As suggested by Murkens, ‘the real test would be if Parliament re-enacted the tribunal fees as an Act of Parliament.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> In <em>UNISON, Leech</em> and <em>Daly,</em> the judicial review challenge was not against primary legislation, but orders and rules made by the executive. Therefore, the three judicial review challenges relied upon well-established principles of judicial review against the executive. However, if the implied limitation is used in practice concerning primary legislation by Parliament, the courts would be embarking on an unprecedented step against the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. </p>

<p>The judgment should be applauded for the robust defence of access to the courts in maintaining the rule of law. Access to the courts is important for the rule of law because ‘without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The truth is that access to courts and tribunals are not just of value to individual litigants, but also to society. Every decision made by courts and tribunals contributes to the establishment of legal principles that applies to everyone. The courts and tribunals across the UK represent an avenue for litigants to enforce their rights. If a party or business fails to meet their obligation, a litigant should be able to seek a remedy against them. This ability to hold the other party to account is particularly important for relationships that are inherently unequal, such as the employer-employee relationship. In the context of employment tribunals, the mere fact that a claim can be brought by an employee will ensure that employers respect the rights provided by Parliament. If onerous fees prevent employees from making claims, employers could potentially disregard rights knowing that they will not be held to account before a court or tribunal.   </p>

<p>Finally, the judgement demonstrates clearly the potential of the common law to protect the right of access to justice, but what about other rights? The first difficulty encountered by the common law as a guarantor of basic rights is that it lacks an established list of constitutional rights. Although, extra-judicially, Lord Cooke included among the list of common law rights: the right of access to a court and to confidential legal advice, the right to a fair trial, the right to equal treatment, and the freedoms of expression and religion;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> as illustrated by Masterman and Wheatle, there ‘remains no complete list of rights which the common law ranks as constitutional.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> In addition, there are some fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights that are missing from Lord Cooke’s list of common law rights.  The right to private and family life provided by Article 8 and the right to freedom of assembly and association provided by Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights are notably absent among others. The weakness of domestic judicial review in protecting rights was noted by the European Court of Human Rights in <em>Smith and Grady v UK.</em> In the context of Article 8, despite the ‘anxious scrutiny’ test being applied where fundamental rights were concerned, the European Court of Human Rights still felt that the threshold for the domestic approach was so high that it was unable to provide adequate protection.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Although <em>UNISON</em> demonstrates that the common law can be an adequate guarantor of the right to access of justice, it is important to note that the right being protected in <em>UNISON</em> has a long history of receiving strong judicial protection. Therefore, the impact of the judgment in highlighting the common law’s ability to protect all rights should not be overstated. It is regrettable that the Court did not comment on the common law’s standard of review for other fundamental rights.As a result, the common law’s ability to guarantee other rights, particularly those less well-established, remains precarious. Whether the common law can adapt and evolve to protect other rights currently recognized under the Convention will be thrust into the spotlight if the UK departs from the European Convention on Human Rights in the future.  </p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h5>

<p>The judgment in <em>UNISON</em> clearly displays the potential for the common law as an instrument to protect basic rights. In this aspect, it continues the narrative driven by the Court in <em>Osborn</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> and <em>Kennedy</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> which highlighted the common law’s protection of the right to a fair hearing and the principle of open justice. In <em>UNISON</em>, the Supreme Court offered a robust defence of the importance of access to justice. However, the judgment leaves open two important questions. First, whether implied limitations apply to primary legislation made by Parliament. Second, despite the Supreme Court demonstrating that the common law will go to lengths to uphold the right of access to justice, it leaves open for discussion whether the common law can also be a powerful defender of other rights.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><em>Lee v McArthur &amp; Ors</em> [2016] NICA 39, commonly known as the ‘Gay Wedding Cake’ case, is currently awaiting judgment from the UK Supreme Court (‘UKSC’). <em>Lee</em> promises to provide vital guidance on how conflicts between the LGBT and faith community should be resolved commercially. This article analyses the judgment handed down by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal (‘NICA’) and concludes that, despite the controversy, an outcome against the bakery is legally unsurprising and desirable within a commercial context.</p>

<p>Mr Lee, a homosexual man from Northern Ireland, ordered a cake from Ashers Bakery with the printed words “Support Gay Marriage”. However, the bakery’s directors – being devoted Christians – opposed the introduction of same-sex marriage because it was in their view contrary to God’s law. Consequently, Mr and Mrs McArthur (the bakery directors) telephoned Mr Lee notifying him that the order could not be fulfilled. Unhappy with this outcome, Mr Lee brought two discrimination claims against Ashers bakery and its directors. First, on the ground of sexual orientation in breach of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (NI) 2006 (‘the 2006 Regulations’). Second, on the ground of religious belief or political opinion contrary to the Fair Employment and Treatment (NI) Order 1998 (‘the 1998 Order’). Challenging these claims, the bakery argued that both statutory provisions breached their rights under Articles 9, 10 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’). In the lower courts, the County Court and NICA held that Mr Lee was directly discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation and political opinion. In addition, both courts agreed that the provisions were compatible with Articles 9, 10 and 14. After the NICA decision, the parties now look towards the highest appellate court for Northern Ireland, the UKSC, for final judgment.</p>

<p>The arguments presented in <em>Lee</em> are similar to those found in <em>Bull and another v Hall and another</em> [2013] UKSC 73. <em>Bull</em> concerns a devout hotelier that only provided double bedroom accommodation to married couples. The hotelier denied the guest, who was in a civil partnership, a double bedroom.Fenton-Glynn observes that the UKSC was fractured in deciding the legal ground upon which the outcome was based<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a>. For the majority, there was direct discrimination against the guest. Lady Hale (with whom Lord Toulson and Lord Kerr agreed) stated that there was great difficulty “in seeing how discriminating between a married and a civilly partnered person can be anything other than direct discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a>. In contrast, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hughes argued that the discrimination could only be indirect because the hoteliers would have denied a room to any non-married, heterosexual or homosexual couple<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a>. This distinction between direct and indirect discrimination is of critical importance as the 2006 Regulations provides that indirect discrimination may be justified, whilst direct discrimination cannot.</p>

<p>The court’s analysis on direct and indirect discrimination in <em>Bull</em> is useful to consider in the context of the present case. Although the source of the discrimination in <em>Lee</em> can be distinguished from that in <em>Bull</em>, the NICA still held that Mr Lee was directly discriminated against. The court’s decision was due to Mr Lee’s association with the LGBT community. The court held that “the benefit from the message or slogan on the cake could only accrue to gay or bisexual people”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a>. Since “ … the use of the word ‘Gay’ in the context of the message prevented the order from being fulfilled”, the bakery had thus refused to associate themselves with the LGBT community<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a>. Moreover, they would not have opposed a cake that said “Support Marriage” or “Support Heterosexual Marriage”. As the 2006 Regulations protects the sexual orientation of the LGBT community, this was a case of direct discrimination. Yet, this is not a novel or odd concept - associative direct discrimination has been a feature of anti-discrimination law since <em>Coleman v Attridge Law</em> [2008] ECJ C-303/06. In this case, Ms Coleman was forced to resign from her job because she had a disabled child. The Employment Tribunal, with the clarification of the European Court of Justice, held that Ms Coleman was directly discriminated against because she was associated with her disabled son.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the court may find <em>Lee</em> to be a case of indirect discrimination. Although the NICA refused to comment on the possibility of indirect discrimination<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a>, the UKSC should consider doing so in the interests of clarity. The regulations provide that the bakery must apply a provision, criterion or practice to Mr Lee which would also apply equally to persons not of the same sexual orientation. In this case, the bakery applied a “Support Gay Marriage” criterion to Mr Lee and all other customers. To prove indirect discrimination, the criterion applied must fulfil three requirements outlined in the regulations<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a>.First, the criterion must place persons of Mr Lee’s sexual orientation at a particular disadvantage when compared with others.Second, the criterion must place Mr Lee at a disadvantage. Third, the bakery must show that the criterion applied is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. By refusing to bake the cake with the words “Support Gay Marriage” for any customer, the bakery puts homosexual individuals at a particular disadvantage because the message could only ever benefit homosexuals and the LGBT community. In addition, the criterion puts Mr Lee at a disadvantage due to his association with and campaign for same-sex marriage. Finally, whilst the bakers have a legitimate aim in protecting their religious beliefs, a proportionate approach would be “to refuse service [for] any religious or political message”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a>. It would be a disproportionate measure to provide a service that only fully benefits those with religious or political views the bakery agrees with. As a result, the court could conclude that the bakers indirectly discriminated against Mr Lee.</p>

<p>In addition, the NICA held that the bakery and its directors directly discriminated against Mr Lee on the ground of religious belief or political opinion<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a>. It is significant that Northern Ireland’s legislature has tried five times between 2012 and 2015 to pass a Marriage Equality Act that would bring legal equivalence between Northern Ireland and the UK. The NICA and County Court noted that, given the political context, it is plain that support or opposition for gay marriage is regarded as a political opinion. For instance, the bakery would not have opposed a cake that read “Support Heterosexual Marriage” and it is evident that the bakery was opposed to gay marriage<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a>. In rejecting the cake, the bakery did not wish to support individuals who held that view. However, the bakery cannot provide a service that only “reflects their own political or religious belief”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a>. As a result, the court should conclude that the directors directly discriminated against Mr Lee on the basis of his political opinion.</p>

<p>The UKSC was also asked to adjudicate on whether the 2006 Regulations and 1998 Order breached Article 9 and 10 of the ECHR. Both rights may be limited if they “are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a>. First, the bakery directors argued that the message was a form of forced speech and contrary to their Article 10 rights.However, the approach the Supreme Court should take is to acknowledge that when a baker conducts a business for profit, he does not associate himself with the message of his cake. For example, a cake celebrating a sports team’s victory does not indicate any support for that team from the baker.Particularly when other types of cakes are considered, the claim that a message is a form of forced speech loses its strength. On the evidence provided by the parties, the NICA found that the cake Mr Lee sought from the bakery was within the normal range of cakes it offered . The bakery advertised services for the transfer of an image and message onto a cake (subject to their terms and conditions). Therefore, the directors were not forced to speak because they had offered the service to the public on their terms. Second, the directors engaged Article 9 by manifesting their religious belief to oppose gay marriage because it was in their view contrary to God’s law. However, the regulations limiting the exercise of religious beliefs must be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. In this case, the legitimate aim of the 2006 Regulations is the protection of the rights and freedoms of Mr Lee and equal treatment in the commercial sphere. Lady Hale in <em>Bull</em> noted that the continuing legacy of discrimination against homosexuals should not be underestimated; Strasbourg requires “very weighty reasons to justify discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a>.Analogously, the 1998 Order protects Mr Lee’s freedom to hold political opinions that the bakery may disagree with and to ensure equal treatment in the commercial sphere regardless of his views. As a result, the court should hesitate to rule that prohibiting service providers from discriminating against homosexuals and individuals with different political beliefs is a disproportionate limitation on their rights.</p>

<p>The implications of <em>Lee</em>  are significant. An outcome in favour of Mr Lee will not only protect members of the LGBT community, but all individuals with protected characteristics under legislation. As a result, the UKSC should reach the same conclusion against a gay-baker discriminating against devout Catholics by refusing a cake with the message “Support Jesus”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>. The claims made by the bakery should be dismissed to ensure that we live in “a society where all individuals are treated equally regardless of the colour of their skin, their sexual orientation, or indeed, their religion”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a>. The decisions made by the County Court and the NICA are welcomed in ensuring equal treatment in the commercial sphere. As the NICA concluded, a service provider “may not provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious belief in relation to sexual orientation”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a>. Therefore, the UKSC should follow the decisions of the lower courts and dismiss the claims made by the bakery.</p>
