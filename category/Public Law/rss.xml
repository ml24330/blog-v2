	     <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>In <em>Elgizouli v Secretary of State for the Home Department</em>, the Supreme Court considered whether it was unlawful for the Secretary of State to authorise mutual legal assistance (“MLA”) to the United States in order to assist a criminal investigation which could lead to the imposition of the death penalty on a suspected British terrorist.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> This article first sets out the factual background and context of this case. It will then go on to examine the Court’s reasoning, particularly on the legality of the Secretary of State’s actions on the basis of common law principles.</p>

<p>The article will situate <em>Elgizouli</em> within existing jurisprudence on common law constitutional rights. In doing so, it will argue that the Court has revealed a more restrictive approach to such rights. Finally, this article will discuss how <em>Elgizouli</em> demonstrates that the scope of common law constitutional rights seems to be limited to procedural rights (as opposed to substantive rights).</p>

<h4 id="background-of-elgizouli">Background of <em>Elgizouli</em></h4>

<p>In <em>Elgizouli</em>, the applicant’s son was suspected of involvement in a terrorist group which committed serious crimes, including the beheading of 27 men in Syria.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> In 2015, the US requested MLA – which enables the US and UK governments to share information for the purposes of criminal proceedings – with respect to an investigation into that terrorist group.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> While the Home Secretary requested the US guarantee that information provided would not be used in a prosecution that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty, the US did not provide such an assurance. Despite the lack of this assurance from the US, the Home Secretary agreed to the MLA request and supplied relevant information to US authorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> While witness statements had already been transferred to US authorities before the case was brought to the courts, the Supreme Court nonetheless emphasised the importance of determining the legality of the Home Secretary’s actions as “[f]urther material may be sought” <a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> by US authorities.</p>

<p>At first instance, it was held in the Divisional Court that the Home Secretary’s actions were neither unlawful under the common law nor the provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> However, the Divisional Court certified two questions of law of public importance: (i) whether the Home Secretary’s exercise of power to provide MLA which will facilitate the imposition of the death penalty was unlawful under the common law; and (ii) whether the Home Secretary’s exercise of power was unlawful under the provisions of the DPA 2018.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> This article will focus on the Supreme Court’s reasoning as to whether the Secretary of State’s actions were unlawful under the common law.</p>

<h5 id="the-supreme-courts-reasoning">The Supreme Court’s reasoning</h5>

<p>The majority held that there was no common law principle which prevented the sharing of information in an MLA request which might lead to the imposition of the death penalty. Lord Kerr was the sole dissenter on this issue and held that the common law ought to recognise that it should be unlawful to facilitate investigations by providing material which might lead to the imposition of the death penalty in a foreign country.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> Of importance is the Justices’ reasoning on the scope of common law constitutional rights and how the common law should (or should not) develop to accommodate new rights.</p>

<p>Giving one of the two substantive judgments of the majority, Lord Carnwath pointed out that “the death penalty […] has never attracted the attention of the common law” with recent developments coming from Parliament or the European Court of Human Rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Consequently, the common law must develop “in line with the European Convention, but not beyond”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> More crucially, as this was a case involving the facilitation of the death penalty by the transfer of information, “the development of a common law rule would have to take account of the fact that […] Parliament has recently legislated in this field, in the 2018 Act”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Given the highly detailed nature of data transfer rules under the DPA 2018, a common law prohibition of transfer of information in certain circumstances could not be reconciled with the statutory data protection regime.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Lord Carnwath thus evinced a limited scope for the development of common law constitutional rights, with such rights inextricably bound up with pre-existing Convention rights and legislative frameworks.</p>

<p>Beyond affirming Lord Carnwath’s reasons, Lord Reed (with whom Lady Black and Lord Llyod-Jones agreed) further argued that the development of the common law must build “incrementally on existing principles”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> In the first place, incremental development preserves “legal certainty” by ensuring that any changes to the common law are undertaken based on “established principles”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Furthermore, parliamentary sovereignty means that the courts should be cautious when developing the common law especially with the “procedural and institutional limitations which restrict the ability of litigation before the courts to act as an engine of law reform”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Against this broader principle, Lord Reed was of the opinion that the common law was not capable of supplying a right prohibiting MLA which could potentially lead to the death penalty because such a right would not be “an incremental step”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Drawing on constitutional and legal policy justifications, Lord Reed similarly envisioned a more restrictive role for the courts in the development of new rights under the common law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Lord Kerr adopted a different approach to common law constitutional rights. Upon examining different sources of constitutional rights, Lord Kerr argued that recognising a right against the provision of information in an MLA request that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty was a “natural and inevitable extension” of the current prohibition of extradition without death penalty assurances.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> In particular, Lord Kerr emphasised that the common law should adapt to afford human rights protection in novel cases; Convention rights merely “represent a threshold protection” and cannot act as “an inhibitor to the development of the common law” in human rights jurisprudence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Lord Kerr thus took a more liberal approach to common law constitutional rights, with the common law being capable of independently evolving to supply human rights protection.</p>

<p>As Fairclough notes, <em>Elgizouli</em> is significant because it lays out key areas of dispute in common law constitutional rights – both relating to “the relationship between the common law and the HRA” as well as “the extent to which common-law rights can develop”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> While Lords Carnwath and Reed arguably conceptualised a more deferential role for common law constitutional rights (both in its relationship to the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”) and the development of new principles), Lord Kerr posited that the common law could dynamically develop outside the boundaries of Convention rights.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis</h4>

<p>To contextualise the significance of <em>Elgizouli</em>, it is important to understand the developing jurisprudence on common law constitutional rights. In recent years, the courts have seemingly engendered a new approach to common law constitutional rights. In particular, the judges have stressed the vigour of the common law in supplying human rights protection. Such an approach was particularly evident in <em>Osborn v Parole Board</em>, where the Supreme Court stated that the HRA “does not supersede the protection of human rights under the common law or statute, or create a discrete body of law based upon the judgements of the European court”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> Instead, the courts should develop constitutional rights in parallel to the HRA. As Elliott notes, <em>Osborn</em> was remarkable in that it “places common-law rights centre-stage, [with] consideration of the ECHR being treated as a secondary matter”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> The possibility for common law constitutional rights to take precedence over and even supply stronger protection than the HRA was demonstrated in two subsequent cases. In <em>Kennedy v The Charity Commission</em>, the claimant argued that Article 10 of the Convention included a right to receive information from public authorities. Rejecting this argument, the Court went on to hold that there was a “common law presumption in favour of openness”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> and that a right to receive information from public authorities could possibly be supplied by the common law. Subsequently, in <em>A v BBC</em>, the Court emphasised that the “common law principle of open justice remains in vigour, even when Convention rights are also applicable”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> As such, this trilogy of cases suggests that the courts have been willing to develop a richer catalogue of common law constitutional rights and that the common law could itself act as a robust defender of human rights.</p>

<p>At first blush, the majority’s reasoning in <em>Elgizouli</em> evinces a much stricter approach to common law constitutional rights and seems to contradict the Court’s liberal approach in the trilogy of cases just discussed. In <em>Osborn</em>, <em>Kennedy</em> and <em>BBC</em>, common law constitutional rights occupied a central position and could even take precedence over the HRA. Yet, common law constitutional rights took a backseat in <em>Elgizouli</em>. In <em>Elgizouli</em>, Lords Reed and Carnwath stated that common law constitutional rights must cautiously and incrementally develop, curtailing the capacity of the common law to evolve and provide stronger human rights protection. The question, then, is whether these positions can be reconciled; or if they cannot, perhaps it might be said that <em>Elgizouli</em> represents the advent of a stricter approach to common law constitutional rights.</p>

<p>On closer analysis, what <em>Elgizouli</em> reveals is that the ambit of common law rights protection has always been relatively limited in scope. In <em>Kennedy</em> and <em>BBC</em>, the right in question was a right to open justice. As Elliott argues, the Court may be particularly willing to enforce certain rights where they are “a reflection of a constitutional principle to which especial curial weight is attached”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> This could explain why a right to open justice was particularly prized by the Court in <em>Kennedy</em> and <em>BBC</em>, as the notion of open justice is tied to rule of law considerations such as transparency and accountability.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> As such, while the common law might be generous with applying certain kinds of rights which are firmly grounded in well-established constitutional principles (such as a right to open justice), they are more reticent when it comes to recognising new types of rights (such as a right against non-facilitation of the death penalty). On this reasoning, <em>Elgizouli</em> sheds light on the limited normative reach of common law constitutional rights as well as the common law’s selectivity in its protection of human rights. While it might be too early to draw a conclusion on the precise scope of common law constitutional rights, it could be argued that the common law is more willing to enforce procedural rights as opposed to substantive rights, especially when those rights are linked to fundamental constitutional principles such as the rule of law.</p>

<p>This reading of <em>Elgizouli</em> might be supported by the judgement of the Supreme Court in <em>Moohan v Lord Advocate</em>. In <em>Moohan</em>, the Court considered the legality of the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 which banned prisoners from voting in the referendum.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Of note is the Court’s discussion of the common law position on the right to vote, which is a substantive rather than procedural right. Lord Hodge stated that the common law has not developed to “recognise a right of universal and equal suffrage from which any derogation must be provided for by law and must be proportionate”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> In so holding, Lord Hodge observed that the right to vote has always been a statutory creation and that it would thus be constitutionally inappropriate for the common law to “override the statutory rules which determine our democratic franchise”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> The Court’s reticence to recognise a right to vote at common law in <em>Moohan</em> aligns with the Court’s reluctance to extend the protection of the common law to the prohibition of supplying information in an MLA which might lead to the death penalty in <em>Elgizouli</em>. Ultimately, as Elliot argues, it seems that “only a subset of common law rights […] form an irreducible nucleus that may be resistant in the face of implacably incompatible primary legislation”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a></p>

<p>Where does this leave us? While <em>Elgizouli</em> does not bring us closer to drawing up a specific catalogue of rights which exist at the common law, it reminds us that common law constitutional rights are ultimately limited in breadth. While the common law might be a rigorous form of human rights protection when it comes to certain types of rights, other forms of rights are delimited from its scope. In particular, the majority in <em>Elgizouli</em> seems to have adopted an especially narrow conception of common law rights, with the development of such rights being constrained by statutory law and pre-existing rights enshrined in the common law. In this regard, there is a strong argument in favour of Lord Kerr’s approach, as he posits that the courts should extend common law principles to supply human rights protection in novel cases. This ties in with Fairclough’s argument that the common law should move towards a more principled approach to the identification of common law constitutional rights – by recognising that common law constitutional rights are normatively underpinned by the rule of law, this opens up the space for more rights to be protected by the common law insofar as they are underpinned by rule of law considerations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Ultimately, while the current scope of common law constitutional rights appears limited, we may not need to be overly concerned as things currently stand. This is because the HRA can be seen as a sufficiently rigorous way of ensuring that human rights are protected in the UK. This is especially so considering that the courts have a far-reaching interpretative duty under Section 3(1) of the HRA to give effect to Convention rights. In particular, the courts have been willing to “depart from the unambiguous meaning of the legislation” to achieve an interpretation that is consistent with the protection of human rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> As such, it could be argued that, where the common law is currently lacking, the HRA fills the lacuna.</p>

<p><em>Elgizouli</em> confirms that the courts are selective when it comes to the breadth of common law constitutional rights. While the picture of human rights protection is not necessarily bleak due to the HRA, we might be more concerned if the HRA faces repeal in the future. It should be noted that the government launched an independent review of the HRA (led by Sir Peter Gross) in December 2020, focusing on the “structural framework” of the HRA instead of the substantive rights encapsulated in the HRA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> While it seems unlikely that the HRA will be repealed in the near future, it remains to be seen how the outcome of the independent review might alter the current working of the HRA. In this sense, <em>Elgizouli</em> serves as a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring that the HRA has the capacity to effectively protect human rights, as common law constitutional rights are unable to offer the same rigour of protection as the HRA.</p>

	     <h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>Western countries take pride in their orderly constitutional systems which reflect their aspirations to respect human rights and the rule of law (“RoL”). However, when considering the actual meaning and intended genuine effect of the RoL, the concept actually generates more confusion than its inconclusive terminology suggests.</p>

<p>Situating the concept of the RoL in the British constitutional system and identifying its role in the exercise of law-making reveals unexpected complications. Recent events, such as Brexit negotiations and the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for the exploration of the true meaning of the RoL in modern Britain and evaluating its role in the British constitution.</p>

<p>Last year, Parliament enacted the Coronavirus Act 2020, in which it granted the Government extensive discretionary powers through delegated legislation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> Later in the year, the Government proposed clauses in the Internal Market Bill that would directly breach international law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> Even though the events clearly had major implications for the RoL, the Government and Parliament were still allowed to proceed with their agenda. The events demonstrate the elusiveness of the RoL and how easily the concept is disregarded. But why has the constitutional order, purportedly based on the RoL, not disintegrated and collapsed? The answer to this question might lie in the fact that the RoL does not hold any tangible value because of its conceptual uncertainty. The concept is correctly encapsulated by Tamanaha, who noted that “everyone is for [the RoL], but have contrasting convictions about what it is”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></p>

<p>This article will argue that the RoL exists only as a descriptive concept of the modern constitution, without a clear definition in both procedural accounts (arguing that the RoL covers only the form of law and its procedures) and substantive accounts (arguing that in addition to its procedural component, the RoL should also require compliance with the substance of the law and human rights). This makes it open to attacks and incapable of being justified by strong argumentation in the legal context. The article will proceed with discussing the incompatibility of a prescriptive RoL with the British constitutional system, particularly with the central principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Moreover, it will explore the role of the RoL in Britain’s political structure and raise concerns about the potential for abuse in this context. The article will conclude with proposals about the future of the RoL.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-law-reassessed">THE RULE OF LAW REASSESSED</h3>

<h4 id="-the-predicament-of-defining-the-rule-of-law-"><u> The predicament of defining the rule of law </u></h4>

<p>British jurists have attempted to define the RoL for more than a century. The most comprehensive explanation of the RoL was provided by Lord Bingham, who listed both procedural and substantive ˝sub-rules˝ that constituted the RoL.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> However, Lord Bingham himself recognised that statutory law does not define the RoL – with the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 being the only statute that mentions the RoL. The Act’s Section 1(a) states: “The Act does not adversely affect the existing constitutional principle of the rule of law”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> According to Bingham, the authors of the 2005 Act found the task of defining the RoL too complex and therefore left it to the judiciary.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> Therefore, the principle is referred to in an Act of Parliament without any comprehensive definition. Arguing before the court that this constitutional principle has been infringed would be extremely onerous. In any event, it goes against the principle of legal certainty.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Even though it remains a legal principle, paradoxically, it also goes against Bingham’s own elaboration on the RoL, presenting the requirement of laws being clear, predictable and questions of legal rights being resolved by application of law and not the exercise of discretion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The principle’s presence in an Act of Parliament would undoubtedly require more certainty as to its meaning than other non-codified principles.</p>

<p>Dicey’s <em>Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution</em> also shed light on the issues of defining the RoL by drawing both from procedural and substantive accounts. Dicey emphasised that the RoL is an inherent feature of English institutions, as opposed to other European countries, e.g., France.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> He stressed three elements that make the English legal system the perfect manifestation of the RoL. Firstly, he claimed that no citizen will be punished except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before ordinary Courts of the land.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Secondly, Dicey reiterated the value of equality under the common law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Thirdly, he stressed that the English constitution’s protection of personal liberties is a result of “judicial decisions on rights of private persons” and not a result of some general principles in foreign constitutions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> There are two aspects of this interpretation worth mentioning: firstly, using judicial decisions and common law as primary proof for the RoL is perhaps not the most convincing argument. It is difficult to establish that judges were guided by the RoL in decision-making while authors of other constitutions were not. Even though judges decide cases in line with procedural requirements, it is still their interpretation of fact and law. Their decisions in many cases, with the lack of common law and statutory basis, tend to be discretionary. Moreover, Supreme Court Justices, despite being bound by the <em>stare decisis</em> doctrine, can evidently still change previously decided law if there are strong grounds for that decision.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a></p>

<p>Secondly, Dicey’s account clearly demonstrates that the RoL is a descriptive rather than prescriptive concept. The constitutional system contains certain elements that, when analysed jointly, encapsulate the RoL – however, rather than the concept acting as a norm or rule that the state ought to comply with, the rule of law instead describes law-making in Britain. While Dicey showed that the RoL was present in the British constitution, Britain itself did not aspire to achieve this ideal, but rather created the system and institutions which turned out to contain characteristics and an inherent value of what Dicey saw as the RoL. In the words of Finnis, Dicey’s RoL is merely “the name commonly given to the state of affairs in which a legal system is legally in good shape”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> That is why it would be hard to say that the RoL is a British achievement as it would be impossible to prove that the concept was the absolute objective of British judges as proposed by Dicey. It is what simultaneously arose with the creation of the British legal system and did not precede its creation.</p>

<p>The descriptive nature of the RoL can also be traced in the procedural account of another legal philosopher, Joseph Raz, who recognised conformity to the RoL as an inherent (but non-prescriptive) value in law-making and a result of an instrumental conception of law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Raz created his own list of principles best explaining the RoL, and particularly emphasised the notions of certainty and prospectivity of laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Evincing a procedural account, Raz associated the RoL with the protection of individuals’ freedom to plan their lives, in the spirit of Hayekian philosophy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Raz suggested that the RoL minimises (or attempts to minimise) the danger of infringing people’s freedom by requiring clear and prospective laws which prevents the danger of ruling by arbitrary power.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a></p>

<p>However, we should question whether the RoL as such (representing legal certainty, predictability and accessibility as proposed by Bingham) is necessary, as its component principles already exist in the British constitution. As Raz himself noted, the RoL is only one of the virtues of today’s laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Indeed, we can find traces of the RoL, in terms of certainty and predictability, in laws. But it is highly questionable whether the constitutional system really requires the umbrella term of the RoL when other, clearer and better established (or at least established to the degree valuable for them to be) legal principles serve a similar purpose. Looking at the RoL as one of law’s inherent virtues, as presented by Raz, the descriptiveness of the concept is additionally reaffirmed by some substantive accounts, like Dworkin’s. His position that the RoL does not stipulate only the narrow ‘rule-book conception’, but that the concept encapsulates people’s moral and political rights,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> calls for rebuttal. With strong emphasis on substantive justice, rights, and even morality, the rights conception cannot introduce a universal RoL concept, and can only describe the understanding of these elements in a specific jurisdiction. After all, even the judge Hercules must rely on the “convictions of his nation’s character”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>Since, as argued by this article, the RoL is not a prescriptive concept, conformity is not required. Despite Raz’s, Bingham’s and others’ explanations, the concept still lacks a dominant uniform definition (which is not atypical for such abstract terms) which only reaffirms its inability to be conformed with. For a better understanding of the concept, two solutions, though both inadequate to resolve the problem, can be proposed. If Raz tried to present conformity to the RoL as conformity to legal certainty, this should have been stated more directly and not under the (overly) generic concept of the RoL. While this definition would contribute to eliminating uncertainty, it would not contribute to defining the RoL, as it would act only as a restatement of other principles and would be essentially without its own essence. On the other hand, keeping the scope of the concept wide would distinguish the RoL from other principles but would also cause it to suffer from disproportionate conceptual uncertainty, rendering any potential prescriptive basis of the concept impossible to establish. This leads us to the fundamental problem explored by this article and to the problem pointed out by Raz himself that the RoL should not be taken blindly, on trust,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> which would be the only option when there is no clear definition.</p>

<p>As opposed to the theories discussed above, Griffith’s sceptical views destroy the concept as a whole but tend to be the most revealing. Griffith saw the RoL as essentially a political concept.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> Notwithstanding the lack of clear definition, the concept became “sacred and untouchable”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> and its special status is being maintained and reinforced by those who oppose any change of status quo – politicians.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> In addition to that,  the RoL is also a common reference made by the judiciary in their judgments; <em>Privacy International</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> being one of the most prominent examples. The Supreme Court emphasised the importance of effective judicial review in upholding the RoL and argued that the ouster clause in s.67(8) of RIPA 2000 <a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> does not disqualify the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. Nevertheless, the Court still did not fully overrule Parliament and ultimately recognised Parliament’s supremacy, stating that the ouster clause can exclude jurisdiction of judicial review when stated in “the most clear and explicit words”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> However, according to Griffith, even the judiciary uses the RoL as a fig leaf <a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> which allows them to exercise political power and should therefore not be considered as a strictly legalistic concept.</p>

<h4 id="-the-incompatibility-of-the-rule-of-law-with-the-institutional-framework-"><u> The incompatibility of the rule of law with the institutional framework </u></h4>

<p>In this section, we turn to the issue of incompatibility of the RoL as interpreted in the aforementioned accounts and as a prescriptive concept with the British institutional framework.</p>

<p>Aristotle contrasted the rule of law, as a state where rulers are constrained by laws, with the rule of individuals, as a state where rulers govern arbitrarily.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> However, we ought to question whether we can distinguish between these two alternatives in the context of the British constitutional system. Laws are made by people – whether in the form of an individual or an assembly.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> As argued by Loughlin, laws are a “human creation” and can therefore not be placed above human will or government of men. Laws are unable to rule because ruling requires action.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> Humans are needed to enforce the law and, in that way, it is them who rule <em>with</em> laws. The state is therefore both the source and the subject of law,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> which means that in practice, the lawmaker (Parliament) is not always (or does not have to be) constrained by the law because all the power to change it lies in its hands. In enacting new laws, Parliament is realistically not accountable to anyone – not even to the already existing laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> The role of the Government will be analysed in the following section.</p>

<p>The reason for this is parliamentary sovereignty. The power of the Parliament to “make or unmake any law whatever” as described by Dicey <a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> prevents the UK from having a prescriptive RoL in the sense of Bingham’s, Dicey’s and Raz’s interpretations in its legal system. Dicey provided his famous definition of parliamentary sovereignty, but also emphasised the importance of the second fundamental principle – the RoL. He argued that the two principles are not counterbalancing forces since Parliament favours the supremacy of the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> He pointed out two RoL characteristics in the British constitution: the stringent procedural requirements of the legislative process and supremacy of the law enforcing parliamentary sovereignty. The flaw of the former will be analysed in the following section whereas the issue of the latter characteristic is discussed here.</p>

<p>Dicey argued that the RoL constrains discretionary power of the government and reinforces the power of Parliament.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Indeed, we cannot claim that the government’s exercise of power is not checked. Judicial review plays an important role in the court’s scrutiny of the legality, reasonableness and procedural propriety of the executive and administrative actions but does not play an important role in the context of the RoL.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> The more appropriate concept used would be rule <em>by</em> law,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> concentrating on the executive function, which is the primary task of the government. This concept also has much stronger prescriptive value, since compliance is required directly by the courts in judicial review. However, according to Schmitt, this concept should not be equated with the RoL, since rule <em>by</em> law can be found even in an absolute monarchy, with the monarch’s will being the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> While an absolute monarchy and judicial review are not two consonant concepts, the mechanism of judicial review could potentially be established in this kind of regime with the aim of scrutinising public bodies’ execution of laws, irrespective of the fact that the laws are the will of the monarch. In this sense, the law is the essential means through which governing is administered.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> Yet, this concept alone is inadequate for guaranteeing that institutional conditions make everything, and everyone subordinate to law because parliamentary sovereignty, as the central concept in British constitution, prevents that.</p>

<p>Rule by law and the procedure of judicial review are therefore not concerned with the way the law was enacted, which occupies a dominant position in the rule <em>of</em> law. The famous <em>Entick v Carrington</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> case emphasised the notion of legality, supporting the idea of rule <em>by</em> law, but it constitutes only a part of the RoL definition, applying to the idea of implementing laws and not legislating. These laws are still not supreme on their own – as explained in the previous section, it is the Parliament that makes and unmakes them. The Government is certainly obliged to follow the laws enacted by Parliament, but their existence is very much dependent on the latter institution. Judicial review therefore scrutinises compliance with laws made by Parliament and protects laws, which ultimately protects parliamentary sovereignty;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> hence, the authority of the institution  and not the law itself. In this spirit, the power of Parliament to legislate is not limited by any principle, and therefore Parliament always prevails over the RoL. This suggests that Dicey was wrong in asserting that the RoL is a constraint on the government. The RoL should actually be considered in the relationship with the law-maker – Parliament – to find who holds the supreme authority.</p>

<p>The question arising from Dicey’s argument that parliamentary sovereignty and the RoL work hand in hand is: Can there be two supreme bodies – the body of Parliament and the body of law? Parliament undoubtedly favours supremacy of the law once the law is created, insofar as it correspondingly guarantees Parliament’s authority. If the law stops serving the purpose Parliament intended it to serve, it will create a new law or repeal old law, regardless of the legitimacy of its decision. Thus, the concept cannot be prescriptive because it is theoretically irreconcilable with the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty which allows Parliament to enact any law, even if it goes against certain RoL principles. The contemporary state of the British constitution allows us to trace the characteristics of the RoL in it but that does not mean that actors are guided by this principle or even compelled to observe it. It is important to remember that the question here is not “<em>will</em> Parliament repeal the supremacy of law, including the law over legislative procedure?” but <em>“can</em> Parliament repeal supremacy of law and change the law over its legislative procedure?” The fact that Parliament cannot bind its successors <a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> does not change the argument – the law can still be changed for at least the mandate of the Parliament in question. Similarly, Parliament can also change its procedural rules of the legislating process which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Parliament has many times demonstrated willingness to create laws preventing citizens from damaging the state’s interests, with the RoL being evidently ignored. While the example might seem exceptional, it nevertheless portrays that Parliament <em>can</em> act contrary to the RoL. In <em>Burmah Oil Company v Lord Advocate</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> the House of Lords decided that the British Government should have compensated Burmah Oil Company for damages done on their oil fields by British soldiers during the Second World War. In response to that, Parliament enacted the War Damage Act 1965, which retrospectively exempted the UK government from liability for war-related damages. This action goes against Bingham’s and Raz’s emphasis on prospectivity in the RoL. Moreover, the 1965 Act manifests the power vested in Parliament through parliamentary sovereignty which is above the courts’ decisions and above any specific law. The constitution does not guarantee the RoL but the rule of people, with no law being above the will of humans.</p>

<h4 id="-the-rule-of-law-in-the-context-of-the-modern-political-system-"><u> The rule of law in the context of the modern political system </u></h4>

<p>In this section, the article will explore the use of the RoL as a political slogan and discuss the impossibility of embedding the RoL in Britain’s political structure.</p>

<p>The British constitution is based on the Westminster model. While power is divided into three branches of government, the traditional notion of the separation of powers, as proposed by Montesquieu, <a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> does not apply in the UK political context.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> The Westminster Model in reality blurs the line between the legislative and executive branch. As a result, the party with the majority in the House of Commons both forms the government and also dominates the legislative process.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> Because of parliamentary sovereignty, the executive gains <em>de facto</em> sovereignty through its dual role in the legislative branch. The ruler is effectively also the legislator. It is true that a bill must go through the amending process of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, but in reality, the executive has proven to be well equipped to achieve its goals through procedural obstacles or even by modifying such obstacles. One example is the Parliament Act 1911.</p>

<p>In 1911, Lloyd George’s Liberal government proposed the Parliament Bill, which downgraded the power of the House of Lords in the legislative process. While all procedural requirements were observed in enacting the 1911 Act, the government clearly pressured the House of Lords to give their consent to the Act for their political purposes of developing social welfare.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> This is a primary example of the power of the executive changing the procedural laws when those do not serve them, without needing to perform a coup d’état. Contrary to Dicey’s theory which emphasised that the RoL is maintained by procedural safeguards in the process of legislating,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> the procedure did not provide any safeguard in this case. Since the Liberals and the coalition prevailed with their votes in the House of Commons and the Lords were passing the bill under a threat from the king to reconfigure the House, the goal of removing procedural backstops for all the future law-making was achieved purely through political conduits. In this sense, any law could be modified according to the wish of the ruling party, even if the change entailed major implications for legislative process and the structure of Parliament by, as Baroness Hale said: “redefining [Parliament] downwards”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> The RoL is impotent in a battle with the rule of people. It was the laws that were adapted to the government’s position and not the government’s position adapted to the laws. It must be noted that while this is not an everyday occurrence, it is these rare cases that demonstrate our legal reality and how state actors are allowed to exercise their powers in practice.</p>

<p>This observation leads us to exploring the RoL as a protection from arbitrariness, as emphasised by Raz.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> According to Schmitt, in the RoL, a legal norm should be distinguishable from the rule of persons “whether it is an individual person, an assembly, or body whose will takes the place of a general norm that is equal for all and determined in advance”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Even though the alterations in the Parliament Act 1911 were proposed by the government (and not one single dictator), its enactment still contradicts Raz’s premise of protection from arbitrariness. Raz acknowledged the extent of power given to the government by law and proposed the RoL as a procedural safeguard against the danger of arbitrariness.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> Even though the Parliament Act went through all the stages of the legislative process and was therefore not arbitrarily made, substantive arbitrariness of the Government’s pursuit of its agenda permeated through the safeguards and nothing like the RoL prevents a similar enactment from taking place again. While the institutional conditions may protect the integrity of the system of rules,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> this protection is not always guaranteed, and certainly not via the concept of the RoL.</p>

<h4 id="-looking-towards-the-future-"><u> Looking towards the future </u></h4>

<p>The concept remains ill-defined and vulnerable to potential abuses. That is why the RoL, as a prescriptive concept, should be removed from common use by both politicians and the judiciary. It should only be explored together with other abstract principles and aspirations promising a better and more just tomorrow (at least until a more uniform definition is found). Nevertheless, in its current state, the RoL cannot provide that. On the contrary, making false pretences and creating the impression of fictitious protection is precarious and threatens the permeation of arbitrariness and dictatorial regime into the British legal system.</p>

<p>Alternatively, in order to make the concept suitable for concrete use not only in political but also legal context, Parliament could consider codifying the RoL in an Act of Parliament and providing a uniform definition. By converting it into valid law, the institutions of the state would be legally obliged to follow the principle. Nevertheless, this solution should be recognised as defective for two reasons: firstly, there is no guarantee that this Act of Parliament would have longevity due to the no entrenchment rule. Secondly, the lack of uniform definition and the inherent vagueness both stand as major barriers on the path towards codification. Also, the fact that other legal principles possibly covered by the RoL, such as legal certainty and prospectivity, are to a great extent observed by lawmakers, the umbrella term of the RoL appears to be redundant in the context of the British constitution.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>This article has demonstrated that the reason for the RoL being repeatedly violated and yet not being properly condemned or even judicially sanctioned is that the concept does not play any substantial role in the British constitutional regime. In fact, it does not really exist in the prescriptive sense. The RoL is desperately deprived of a concrete definition, which renders it unsuitable to be incorporated into the system as one of the constitutional principles. Moreover, the concept can only be recognised in a descriptive form while still being greatly incompatible with institutions of British constitution and being circumvented or even abused in the political context. The safest option for both the legal system and citizens would be to remove it altogether from our legal and political structure. Nevertheless, it appears to be much too useful for creating vagueness and false impression of untouchability of laws to be forgotten so easily.</p>

	     <h5 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h5>

<p>Scientific research suggests that the implementation of artificial wombs for human fetuses (ectogenesis) is foreseeable within the next few decades,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> having already been used successfully for lamb fetuses.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> However, the current law is ill-equipped to deal with the conflict of rights which will ensue. Ectogenesis will reshape pre-natal viability and procedures, decreasing the mortality rate of extremely premature fetuses. As such, it will have a direct impact on the stage at which a fetus is deemed to be viable.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> Under the current law, viability is an important criterion for criminalising the termination of an unborn fetus. This article focuses on how Artificial Womb Technology (AWT) may limit the right to abortion. Furthermore, it will argue that reform is required to rebalance the maternal/fetal interest in abortion law, specifically focusing on how future legislation should classify AWT in order to restore the doctrine of viability.</p>

<p>While this article recognises that abortion is an ethically-charged issue, it does not aim to discuss the ethical implications of abortion. Instead, it will focus on proposing a solution to ensure that the right to abortion is protected in the advent of AWT, and to shed light on an impending dilemma with huge legal implications on the current application of abortion laws.</p>

<h5 id="ii-the-offence-of-child-destruction">II. The Offence of Child Destruction</h5>

<p>Section 1(1) of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother, shall be guilty… of child destruction.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst originally this was not intended to be concerned with abortion,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> it is now accepted that an unlawful abortion could fall within the scope of this offence. In <em>C v S</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> a putative father challenged the potential abortion of his unborn child. The courts contemplated whether an abortion would constitute a criminal offence under the IL(P)A 1929. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal found that the child was not capable of being born alive, and the doctor would thus not be guilty of the offence. The extensive and detailed judicial application of the aspects of the born alive test in this case indicate that the courts did not preclude the possibility that the offence (under the IL(P)A 1929) could apply to abortion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a></p>

<p>The applicability of child destruction to unlawful abortion was confirmed in <em>Rance v Mid-Downs Health Authority</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Brooke J, in determining whether an abortion of a disabled fetus was lawful, stated that the abortion would be “prima facie rendered lawful under… the Act of 1967, provided it did not involve the destruction of the life of a child ‘capable of being born alive,’ contrary to section 1 of the Act of 1929”.<a class="inline-reference" d="inline8" href="#8">8</a> He applied the born alive test stating that “The question of mixed fact and law” is whether the fetus  “would have been a child capable of being born alive”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Whilst the fetus was not found to meet this threshold, Brooke J’s application of the test evidences that an unlawful abortion could fall within the scope of the child destruction offence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a></p>

<p>Further evidence of the applicability of child destruction to abortion was given in a Parliamentary debate in 1988. Lord Skelmersdale expressed the notion that “because of the interaction between” the IL(P)A and the Abortion Act (AA) 1967,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#11">11</a> child destruction has evolved into a possible prosecutorial tool against unlawful abortion by placing “a de facto limit below which a doctor performing an abortion has the benefit of an automatic defence.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Essentially, the offence of child destruction catches any procedures which fall outside of the AA 1967’s criteria.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the AA 1967 supports the notion that the offence of child destruction is still relevant today. Section 5 states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“(1) No offence under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 shall be committed by a registered medical practitioner who terminates a pregnancy in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) For the purposes of the law relating to abortion, anything done with intent to procure a woman’s miscarriage … is unlawfully done unless authorised by section 1 of this Act”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, the AA 1967 restricts the scope of the offence of child destruction but does not replace it. It indicates the offence is still very much relevant to abortion if the procedure is performed outside of the conditions provided by Section 1.  Accordingly, when Section 5 was inserted into the AA 1967 in 1990, Parliament made the express decision to retain child destruction’s applicability to abortion. Thus, the IL(P)A 1929 implies that a viable fetus has an interest in life, which may only be circumscribed in the circumstances provided by paragraphs (b) to (d) of S1(1) AA 1967.</p>

<p>Strangely, the Abortion Act never became the sole authority on abortion by replacing the IL(P)A, especially considering the intermission between the latter and the enactment and amendments to the former. Romanis argues that this was a deliberate decision by the legislature.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> This is an ostensible indication of Parliament’s intention to continue to criminalise the abortion of viable fetuses, by, in theory, not instating the Abortion Act as the sole authority, but essentially as a <strong>defence</strong> to child destruction. Evidence of this ‘deliberate decision’ can be demonstrated in a 1988 debate rejecting the report of a Select Committee which suggested the IL(P)A’s ‘born alive’ test be disengaged from Section 5(1) of the AA 1967.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Lord Robertson fervently objected to this, asserting that “a cardinal principle is that abortion should not be allowed where the child is capable of being born alive.” <a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> He suggested that the AA 1967’s viability threshold is meant to serve as an “upper limit”, and thus to depart from the IL(P)A’s test was “wrong”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Therefore, Romanis is well-founded in her argument that the legislature deliberately maintained the distinction between the two Acts.</p>

<p>In plain, the offence of child destruction seems to affirm the importance of the viability doctrine within English law. The purpose of criminalising the abortion of a viable fetus is, <em>prima facie</em>, the protection of the fetus. Accordingly, a maternal/fetal balance can be observed as an interest of the law. </p>

<h5 id="iii-the-right-to-abortion">III. The Right to Abortion</h5>

<p>In contrast, the right to abortion protects a woman’s autonomy and has been recognised as a fundamental right in many states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> The <em>Roe v Wade</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> decision in the United States is an illustration of this - the Supreme Court recognised that abortion was within the constitutional right of privacy, stating that “the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a></p>

<p>Under  English law, the AA 1967 legalises abortion in a broad range of circumstances provided in Section 1(1)(a)-(d): when it is clear that continuing the pregnancy involves risk to the woman, which must become even graver after the twenty-four week threshold, or that the fetus suffers from severe abnormalities. The legality of abortion in these circumstances essentially provides a defence to the child destruction offence under the IL(P)A 1929.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is a well-established principle that the fetus has no legal personhood, under any circumstances, before birth.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> In <em>Paton v British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> the court held that, as a matter grounded in common law, “The foetus cannot… have a right of its own at least until it is born and has a separate existence from its mother”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>However, after viability, which is the point from which the fetus is developed enough to live “indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> the IL(P)A 1929 implies that a fetus gains  an interest to be born by imposing criminal sanctions on its killing, providing the fetus with what is possibly the only legal protection it will receive pre-birth.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, some academics argue that abortion is not a right in the UK, instead, it is merely a procedure that can take place if the correct medical criteria (set out in Section 1 of the AA 1967) are met.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> The weight of this argument is reinforced by the aforementioned criminalisation of any abortion performed outside of the context of the AA 1967. Nevertheless, such a viewpoint ostensibly discounts the importance of human rights jurisprudence, which indicates that access to abortion is gradually evolving into a positive right.</p>

<p>For instance, the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that access to legal abortion is linked to the right to private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In <em>Tysiąc v Poland,</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> the court held that a state cannot escape a procedural obligation to make abortion available where the law allows it. Whilst this is a development in Strasbourg’s abortion jurisprudence from the decision of <em>Brüggemann and Scheuten v Germany</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> which held that a woman’s choice with her pregnancy is not concerned with Article 8, it focuses on the procedural aspects of the law, and suggests that Strasbourg is reserved in deciding “substantive violations” of abortion as a fundamental right.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> In <em>Tysiąc</em>, the court accepted that a state cannot prohibit abortion for therapeutic reasons (to protect the mother’s life). Here, the state still owes procedural safeguards due to its “measures affecting fundamental human rights”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> However, it was asserted that “once the legislature decides to allow abortion, it must not structure its legal framework in a way which would limit real possibilities to obtain it”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Strasbourg’s stance, therefore, affirms “that women’s right to access legal abortion may not be illusory”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> but for now is unprepared to address any substantive issues of abortion.</p>

<p>Accordingly, abortion is a right which is becoming increasingly recognised by law. This could be threatened if English law cannot keep pace with the technological advancements in the field of neonatal care.</p>

<h5 id="iv-implications-of-artificial-womb-technology">IV. Implications of Artificial Womb Technology</h5>

<h5 id="iva-the-change-in-viability-and-the-effect-on-criminalisation"><em>IV(a). The change in viability and the effect on criminalisation</em></h5>

<h6 id="iimpact-ofawt-on-the-viability-doctrine"><u>(i).  Impact of  AWT on the viability doctrine</u></h6>

<p>AWT will inevitably have implications on the doctrine of viability. Viability is a seemingly blurred concept as a judicial tool,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> yet tries to classify fetal status upon which the legality of an abortion is usually based. In the UK, the AA 1967 places viability at twenty-four weeks, before which most abortions should take place to avoid prosecution. However, the real question of viability is naturally much more nuanced, and each case has its own subtleties which make a certain answer almost impossible.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a></p>

<p>AWT would further impede this because a fetus would reach viability before the AA 1967’s twenty-four week threshold in the sense that “if removed, it could fully gestate” within ectogenesis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> To that end, Parliament might consider removing the threshold as it will no longer be an accurate reflection of viability. While this may appear speculative, it seems a likely course of action considering that AWT will destabilise the current understanding of viability which is integral to abortion law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> Accordingly, the retention of any quantitative measure of viability will become very difficult where an embryo could be deemed viable from conception. Furthermore, unless Parliament can find another way to balance the rights of the mother and fetus without the doctrine of viability, which risks being made obsolete by AWT, it is possible that they will elect to retain the pre-existing ‘capable of being born alive’ test under the IL(P)A 1929. This is again likely due to the discretionary nature of the test, which may allow the question of viability in the era of AWT to be dealt with by the scientific understanding at the time. As many academics have agreed, “there is not a sufficient replacement for the standard of viability” and any possible alternatives “are flawed” in the absence of abortion jurisprudence not based upon viability.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Consequently, the most desirable solution to this dilemma would be to somehow retain viability, or the balance of interests would shift entirely to the mother or fetus, undercutting the temporal compromise that the law has endeavoured to achieve.</p>

<h6 id="iiwill-the-ilpascapable-of-being-born-alive-threshold-limit-access-to-abortion-if-awt-is-deemed-a-factor-of-viability"><u>(ii).  Will the IL(P)A's  'capable of being born alive threshold' limit access to abortion if AWT is deemed a factor of viability?</u></h6>

<p>If Parliament opts to retain the ‘born alive’ test, it will be deleterious to abortion access. Fetal viability would be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on factors such as abnormalities. The lack of a clear and quantitative threshold would naturally leave the question of viability to the courts unless Parliament expressly rejected viability as a judicial tool upon the advent of AWT. As Sir John Donaldson MR stated in <em>C v S</em>, the IL(P)A test, whilst being subject to medical evidence, “essentially depends upon the interpretation of the statute and is a matter for the courts”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> However, increased judicial discretion would render courts the gatekeeper to abortion. Judges are not medical professionals and often rely on medical evidence, which would suggest that a fetus is always ‘capable of being born alive’ with AWT. Therefore, women would have no time to reflect on the reasons (financial or otherwise) for which they may seek an abortion (after previously having twenty-four weeks) before abortion is criminalised under the IL(P)A. With over 99% of abortions taking place within the limits set by the current AA 1967 twenty-four week viability threshold,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> this would substantially limit access to abortion.  Appropriately, this may be averse to fetal interests as well, as mandating a woman to give birth on account of viability regardless of her reasons for seeking abortion could have negative effects on the quality of the child’s upbringing. </p>

<p>If AWT becomes an admissible factor of viability in a judicial context, it will criminalise a substantial amount of abortions, for the reasons stated above. This could represent a shift in the law of abortion, from being rooted in feminist theory, to having a pro-life stance, and is a further reason that a solution must be obtained to address the pending legal concerns of AWT. This may be obviated should AWT be inadmissible as evidence of viability, and this idea will be developed further in this paper.</p>

<h5 id="ivb-the-socioeconomic-implications-of-limited-access-to-abortion"><em>IV(b). The socioeconomic implications of limited access to abortion</em></h5>

<p>As it has been identified, the current application of viability in the context of AWT will become obsolete, and its retention may substantially limit access to abortion. Therefore, AWT is far from settling the abortion debate. Accordingly, Schultz believes that in the U.S., where some States are hostile towards abortion, the expedition of viability may give them an opportunity to “dramatically limit abortion” under its current application.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> Whilst there is no evidence that the UK will intentionally act in the same way, it is necessary to address the implications of limiting abortion.</p>

<p>The law desires a balance between maternal and fetal interest. However, with AWT, the balance would tip towards the fetus, which not only comprises issues of autonomy, but other socioeconomic factors. Women seek abortions for a variety of reasons: For example, a study identified that 40% of women (the highest portion) sought abortion for financial reasons.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> If a woman without the means to raise a child is denied abortion as a result of AWT’s expediated viability, “implications for the well-being of their offspring” may arise,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> such as financial hardship during childhood, development issues caused by a lack of parental affection and more.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a></p>

<p>Although a common counter-argument is that women desiring abortion would have the option to gestate ex-utero for adoption, a woman may actually seek abortion to avoid genetic motherhood and “rid herself of the burden” of knowing she has an existing child.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> It is also strange that whilst AWT will affect the theoretical viability of the fetus and have the effect of limiting abortion access, many women would not have the financial means to access AWT. Thus, the limit they may face to abortion access is based upon an unachievable standard of viability. </p>

<p>Another important point is that abortions will occur unsafely if they are unduly limited. <a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> This will undoubtedly lead to a lot of expense in treating complications from unsafe abortion, which is estimated to affect around 20-50% of women who have one.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a></p>

<p>Clearly then, the law must change to attempt to reconcile the balance of maternal/fetal rights in the face of an endangered viability doctrine. However, if a meaningful viability mechanism cannot be retained, this balance becomes extremely difficult and the law will most likely tilt to either a feminist or pro-life stance. </p>

<h5 id="ivc-the-legal-status-of-fetuses"><em>IV(c). The legal status of fetuses</em></h5>

<p>It is a well-established common law principle that legal personhood is crystallised at birth.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> Therefore, the right to life under Article 2 of the ECHR does not extend to a fetus;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> an interpretation not without contention. For example, Judge Mularoni’s dissent in <em>Vo v France</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> asserted that a lack of personhood should not disqualify all recognition and protection for the fetus’ right to life.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> She draws upon the <em>Oviedo Convention </em>to substantiate her point<em>, </em>which regulates the use of potential prenatal genetic modifications and wider misuse of biotechnology in order to protect the interests and dignity “of everyone, including the unborn”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> This suggests that the unborn does not necessarily lack protections associated with a right to life. Her argument is convincing, as it highlights that there is a propensity to ‘cherry-pick’ when the unborn is protected, e.g. not against abortion but against the misuse of biotechnology.  Nevertheless, a distinction should be made that in an abortion context, a conflict of rights would arise were the fetus given a right to life against the mother’s autonomy. Meanwhile, in terms of the protection that Oviedo supplies (against biotechnological abuse), there is no clash of rights between the unborn and any immediate person. </p>

<p>Accordingly, if a fetus were to be given legal personhood, the right to abortion could be sidestepped completely. Despite this, Romanis has correctly identified that if a fetus is extracted from the womb to be placed into an artificial womb, it has been born by the definition of birth under Section 41 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, which is “a child born alive”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> As a fetus placed into ectogenesis will not be dead, this definition will have been fulfilled, possibly affording it legal personhood. This would be the first instance in which a gestating fetus would have personhood under the law. Some believe that this is justified, as Colgrove asserts that fetuses taken from the womb to be placed within ectogenesis “are newborns (although very young ones)”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> Nevertheless, to give personhood to a fetus being placed into AWT would eliminate the mother’s ability to terminate the pregnancy without committing infanticide. This poses the question as to whether a woman’s autonomy and choice to abort should extend to when the fetus is no longer the subject of her womb, which seems foreign to the ‘my body, my choice’ doctrine. Nevertheless, as discussed, abortion is mainly sought for reasons that have nothing to do with the woman’s body, but instead her circumstances. Therefore, to afford legal personality to the subject of ectogenesis would reject this and subvert the temporal balance in law between the maternal/fetal rights and risk the fetal interests outweighing the mother’s. </p>

<p>Therefore, it is advisable that Parliament should address the definition of birth to make sure it cannot afford personhood to fetuses being placed into ectogenesis. A definition should classify AWT as merely an extension of the womb, unlike regular incubation, so birth cannot occur until a fetus is alive outside of the womb or any device acting as such. </p>

<h5 id="v-looking-forward-defining-awt-as-the-female-womb">V. Looking Forward: Defining AWT as the Female Womb</h5>

<p>Clearly, the many implications of AWT threaten viability, and destabilise the maternal/fetal balance. At first glance, the concept of viability will simply cease to be compatible with the context of abortion law once AWT is available. With viability from any stage of pregnancy, it is no longer a question, and so can no longer be a meaningful tool to balance the interest of the fetus against that of the mother. Consequently, without a meaningful standard of viability, the law must evidently shift to either retain the mother’s right to abortion (to avoid complete criminalisation of abortion) and eliminate the interests of the viable fetus, or vice versa. </p>

<p>However, this article suggests a re-conception of the viability threshold. The law generally aims to balance maternal/fetal interests through the viability standard.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a>In the U.S., where abortion is deemed a constitutional right, landmark decisions such as <em>Roe v Wade,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Planned Parenthood v Casey</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> and <em>Gonzales v Carhart</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> highlight the importance of viability as a tool to maintain the maternal/fetal balance. The viability thresholds in English law observed in the Abortion Act and IL(P)A are just further proof of the integration of the viability doctrine within abortion jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Therefore, retaining the doctrine of viability would be the most legally desirable outcome. Hence, Parliament should anticipatorily elect to not differentiate an artificial womb from a natural womb. This could be achieved by the insertion of a statutory provision into the Acts governing abortion, the AA 1967 and the IL(P)A 1929. Such a provision would classify AWT as the natural womb, or an extension thereof. Accordingly, there would be no differentiation in terms of the law of abortion between the wombs, and AWT could not be considered as a factor in viability. Following this approach, fetal viability would be judged against its <em>chance of survival</em> <em>if it were to be removed from ectogenesis</em>. </p>

<p>This would allow for the retention of viability, along with the statutory thresholds of the Abortion Act and IL(P)A. In essence, this approach would maintain the status quo and the manner in which abortion law is currently applied. Some may argue that this would be a missed opportunity to reform the law under a complete feminist stance, which would consolidate abortion as an absolute and unlimited right. Yet with only 0.1% of terminations taking place after the twenty-four week threshold in England and Wales in 2018,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> and 80% occurring before even 10 weeks,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> changing the law in a feminist direction and destabilising the sacred balance of interests would only make a trivial difference compared to upholding the viability doctrine via the proposed solution. In practice, the likelihood of late abortion based upon choice, and not necessity, is hypothetical, and such an approach would not have a detrimental effect on the pro-choice campaign.</p>

<h5 id="vi-conclusion">VI. Conclusion</h5>

<p>To conclude, AWT poses some dilemmas for the future, and will deem current legislative thresholds on viability obsolete. An analysis of the right to abortion has characterised it as evolving into a widely recognised right, and thus Parliament should act quickly on the ways to reconcile the relationship between AWT and abortion. Furthermore, if the laws are not amended, the viability doctrine will become ephemeral under AWT and will pose grave implications to women’s autonomy and access to abortion, including its criminalisation thereof.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whilst it is deemed legally desirable to balance the interests of the mother and the fetus, such a balance will be unable to be founded upon viability if AWT is deemed to be a factor thereof, and the concept will become superfluous. Therefore, to restore the balance, Parliament should consider approaches to AWT which retain the viability doctrine, which many argue is irreplaceable.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> This paper has suggested that the most simplistic approach to this is for a statutory provision to clarify that an artificial womb is to be treated no differently as the mother’s womb. Therefore, the AWT is not to be considered a factor of viability.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>It is safe to say that the claimants in <em>Fearn v Tate Gallery</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a>, owners of multi-million pound, highly exclusive London flats, are not among the neediest of those who have applied to human rights law for help. However, the decision of Mann J in the High Court,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> while focusing primarily on the tort of nuisance, did raise an issue under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) of considerable importance – horizontal effect<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a>, and the development of the common law in accordance with human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p>

<p>This piece will focus on this important issue, as it was dealt with on appeal by the Court of Appeal. As the Court dealt with the issue with relative brevity, focusing much of its analysis on the question of tort law outlined below, this piece will use the decision as a springboard for analysing more broadly the process by which horizontal effect is created under the HRA. In doing so, it will also serve as a response to a prior case note published on this forum, written by Thomas Yeon on the High Court decision in <em>Fearn</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Contrary to Yeon, who supports the High Court’s approach to the issue, this piece will argue that the approach of Mann J left a great deal to be desired, and that the decision of the Court of Appeal is to be commended, as a welcome reassertion of a preferable approach to horizontal effect under the HRA. Having first set out the distinction in approach between the two courts, it will argue that the approach of the Court of Appeal is preferable for two reasons. The first is that it is far more consistent with past authorities, including a number of well-known Supreme Court decisions on horizontal effect. The second is that it is also far more consistent with a more normative, but no less critical, element of HRA jurisprudence, best expressed as ‘keeping the powder dry’.</p>

<h5 id="court-of-appeal-decision">Court of Appeal Decision</h5>

<p>In order to understand the importance of the Court of Appeal’s decision on the HRA point, it is necessary briefly to re-examine the approach taken by Mann J at first instance.</p>

<p>The facts of the case are, in fact, relatively straightforward. The claimants resided in a block of flats on the south side of the River Thames known as ‘Neo Bankside’, much of which was built from large glass panels. The result of this was that visitors to the nearby Tate Modern viewing gallery had a near-unimpeded view into the flats, and, according to the claimants, frequently used binoculars to get a better view, or even took photos which later emerged on social media. At its barest, the question facing both courts was the same – whether the tort of nuisance is capable of covering ‘overlooking’, and if it is not, whether the HRA makes any difference to that conclusion. Mann J held that the tort <em>did</em> cover overlooking, finding enough in the seminal decision in <em>Hunter v Canary Wharf</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> to support his conclusion. However, at paragraph 170, he then went on to hold that, “if there were any doubt about that, then in my view, that doubt has been removed by the Human Rights Act 1998 and Article 8.” In essence, Mann J’s conclusion was that English tort law <em>most likely</em> already covered the facts before him, but that if he was wrong about that, Article 8<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> <em>certainly</em> covered them, and a combination of the two would produce the unassailable conclusion that the claimants had a good claim.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> This process, in Mann J’s view, was the correct approach to take when developing the common law in line with human rights claims, as courts must do in order to comply with their obligations under Section 6(3)(a) HRA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<p>The Court of Appeal disagreed on more or less every level, with the exception of the ultimate result. On the tort law question, the Court found that the “overwhelming weight of judicial authority” pointed against Mann J’s conclusion that English law covered ‘overlooking’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> However, more importantly for present purposes, the Court of Appeal held that there were “a number of errors of principle” with the manner in which Mann J had approached the HRA question. They held that the correct manner in which to approach the obligations thrust upon a court by Section 6(3)(a) was a strict three-stage test: first asking if English law covers the situation, then if the ECHR covers it, then, finally, whether it is “appropriate” to extend English common law to cover the situation at hand.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> On the facts before them, the Court concluded that, while there was a mismatch between English law and the ECHR, it was not “appropriate” to extend the tort of negligence to remedy this, as to do so would “significantly distort the tort in some important respects.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Thus, although for dramatically different reasons, the claimants lost again.</p>

<h5 id="consistency-i-past-authorities">Consistency I: Past Authorities</h5>

<p>The problem with Mann J’s approach can be summarised very succinctly – he viewed Section 6(3)(a) as requiring him to use human rights arguments as a ‘top-up’, if the arguments under English law were not quite sufficient to get the claimants over the line and create a successful claim. Rather than viewing the English law question and the ECHR question independently, Mann J inelegantly conflated the two, holding that the arguments under <em>Hunter</em> had provided the claimants with a case that was almost watertight, and the remaining uncertainties could be mopped up by deploying Article 8.</p>

<p>Yeon argues, in his piece, that this approach is the “correct and appropriately restrained” approach to take as regards the obligations of courts under Section 6(3)(a). In this section, it will be argued that, contrary to Yeon’s argument, this approach was totally inconsistent with past authorities, and that the Court of Appeal’s approach was correct.</p>

<p>Yeon cites, as authority for what he calls the “correct and appropriately restrained judicial approach” of Mann J, the oft-quoted judgment of Baroness Hale in <em>Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> In particular, Yeon cites paragraph 132, in which Baroness Hale confirmed the developing interpretation of Section 6(3)(a), namely that it does not require courts to create any new causes of action between private parties, but instead to develop the common law compatibly with ECHR principles. The correctness of this approach is indisputable, but Yeon fails to appreciate that <em>Campbell</em> only assists so far with the question in <em>Fearn</em>. It stands for the principle that courts should confine themselves to <em>developing</em> the common law rather than <em>remaking</em> it, but Baroness Hale does not express any opinion on the specific approach a court should take when so doing. Thus, <em>Campbell</em> is certainly authority for the proposition that Mann J could not have simply applied Article 8 as if it were itself a tort, and should instead have considered <em>incorporating</em> the provisions of Article 8 into English law. However, it is <em>not</em> authority for anything as regards <em>when</em> or <em>how</em> this incorporation should take place. Put more straightforwardly, <em>Campbell</em> speaks only to the broad-brush approach courts should take in interpreting Section 6(3)(a), it does not deal with the specifics of doing so. More is therefore required to assess the validity of Mann J’s approach.</p>

<p>Authority on <em>the manner in which</em> the obligation cited in <em>Campbell</em> should be implemented abounds. For clarity, it is important to distinguish this line of authority from that which Jonathan Morgan quite correctly terms ‘equivocal’ – “what the HRA requires of a court faced with a “horizontal” human rights claim” as a substantive matter is, indeed, somewhat unclear, but the <em>procedure</em> under which they should arrive at a determination of “what the HRA requires” is not.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Perhaps the clearest example comes from the Supreme Court decision in <em>A v BBC</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>, particularly paragraph 57 of Lord Reed’s judgment. There, the now President of the Supreme Court confirmed that, in the context of Section 6(3)(a), “the starting point” is always domestic law, in this case, the “domestic principle of open justice”. Only once this has been assessed, he went on to say, should the question of Convention rights emerge, and only then should “the capacity of the common law to develop”become relevant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a>  On the facts of the case, Lord Reed was not required to go beyond the first of the three questions, holding the long-standing principle of open justice to be sufficient, but the decision is nonetheless important for its clarity as regards the process to be followed under Section 6(3)(a). It is clear that this approach is that taken by the Court of Appeal in <em>Fearn</em>, not by Mann J – the three questions must be strictly delineated, and it is impermissible to ‘top-up’ a domestic law argument with human rights considerations as a result.</p>

<p><em>A</em> can count itself as part of a long line of authority to this effect, with Lord Reed citing a seven-Justice Supreme Court to the same effect in <em>Kennedy v Charity Commission</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> as one example. Indeed, the incorrectness of Mann J’s approach was actually confirmed yet again by the Supreme Court on the very same morning that the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Fearn</em> was handed down, in <em>R (Jalloh) v Home Secretary</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> In the very first paragraph of her judgment, Baroness Hale clarified her own words in <em>Campbell</em>, although this time in the context of Article 5 ECHR, and the tort of false imprisonment. With characteristic clarity, Baroness Hale wrote that “this case is about the meaning of imprisonment at common law and whether it should, or should not, now be aligned with the concept of deprivation of liberty in Article 5 of the ECHR”.</p>

<p>It is crystal clear, therefore, that the approach taken by Mann J in <em>Fearn</em> was wrong as a matter of authority. To borrow the Court of Appeal’s phrase, “the overwhelming weight of judicial authority” falls in favour of the three-step approach they advocated, and against the ‘topping-up’ approach Mann J, perhaps unwittingly, applied. To the extent that Yeon suggested otherwise, his argument is untenable as a matter of basic precedent, and <em>Campbell</em> provides little more than umbrella-level guidance on a much more technical issue.</p>

<h5 id="consistency-ii-keeping-the-powder-dry">Consistency II: Keeping the Powder Dry</h5>

<p>Yeon’s argument is not just untenable as a matter of precedent, however. It is submitted here that the reverse approach taken by the Court of Appeal is to be immeasurably preferred as the “correct and appropriately restrained judicial approach” more generally. By contrast, Mann J’s approach should, with respect, be cast away as potentially dangerous and unprincipled.</p>

<p>This is so for three reasons, which can essentially be summarised as a failure to respect the utility of ‘keeping the powder dry’ – failure to respect the sheer power of the HRA, and the enormous value that is therefore inherent in only deploying it when necessary, and on some occasions, leaving domestic law to do its job.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Mann J’s approach in <em>Fearn</em> stands firmly at odds with the approach taken to Section 6(3)(a) <em>overall</em>, aside from the question of <em>strict precedent</em>. The debate as to the proper interpretation of the Section has, since before it was enacted, been firmly bookended by two diametrically opposite positions. At one end is the view of Sir William Wade, who predicted that the Section could be immensely powerful.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> More specifically, his view was that the Section had the power to “transform” or outright “abolish” the common law. At the other end entirely is the view of, <em>inter alia</em>, Sir Richard Buxton, who argued, extrajudicially, that the proper role of human rights was to regulate the relationship between state and citizen, and that the Section should be read very narrowly to reflect this.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a></p>

<p>English law has settled firmly for a middle-ground between the two<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> – Wade’s conception of post-HRA law is simply too extreme to have been what Parliament intended (or at the very least, a change as radical as effectively creating a tort of ‘breach of human rights’ would need language far more explicit than that present in Section 6(3)(a)). Buxton’s view, on the other hand, unnecessarily emasculates human rights law by shutting off its power from a vast swathe of legal disputes in which it could justifiably be of use, and in any case, presents a narrower view of the discipline than that to which the European Court of Human Rights subscribes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> In striking this middle ground, English law has recognised the value of ‘keeping the powder dry’, by limiting the power of the HRA, and ensuring it is not over-applied. Mann J’s approach presents an application of Section 6(3)(a) that is far too close to Wade’s view. The idea that the ECHR can be used to ‘top-up’ or ‘fill in the gaps’ for slightly defective domestic common law arguments suggests the HRA has created a kind of human rights ‘background radiation’ – a general ether of powerful legal principle that judges can call upon at will to expand the reach of the common law. This is certainly a “transformation” of the common law, as Wade warned, and thus is firmly <em>contra</em> the approach carefully laid down in <em>Douglas</em>, <em>Campbell</em> and many others since 2000.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is not simply that this middle ground persists as regards Section 6(3)(a). In fact, it is an approach discernible more broadly across the Human Rights Act. There are a number of principles of HRA adjudication disclosing a palpable recognition of the power that the Act gives courts, and a concomitant reticence to deploy that power unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps the most important example of this is the judgment of Lord Reed in <em>ANS v ML</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a>, which concerned Section 3 HRA. Recognising the enormous power of the Section to reinterpret Parliamentary legislation, Lord Reed felt the need to reiterate the manner in which it must be deployed, namely “only where the legislation, if read and given effect according to ordinary principles, would result in a breach of the Convention rights”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> This is a clear example of a desire to ‘keep the powder dry’ more generally. Section 3, much like Section 6(3)(a), is an enormously powerful tool, and it is for precisely this reason that Lord Reed, exactly like the Court of Appeal in <em>Fearn</em>, felt the need to ensure the boundaries of its use were correctly and stringently regulated. In both cases, the courts therefore laid down a common approach, confirming that human rights arguments should not be deployed unless ordinary domestic law cannot cover the situation at hand. Thus, clearly, Mann J’s approach in <em>Fearn</em> does not simply go against the prevailing approach under Section 6(3)(a), it counteracts a more general desire discernible in HRA caselaw to ‘keep its powder dry’, and ensure its vast power is regulated.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is, of course, one thing to suggest that Mann J’s approach goes against the <em>general trend</em> of ‘keeping the powder dry’, but entirely another thing to suggest that he is wrong in doing so. Perhaps Wade was on to something – maybe human rights law should seek to implant itself into domestic common law as far as possible and have far greater horizontal effect than it does at present. However, it is submitted here that this is not as desirable as it might sound on the surface. The most common argument advanced in this direction is a purely constitutional one – the vast majority of the power afforded by the HRA goes to the judiciary, and the pseudo-legislative power in, among others, Sections 3<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> and 6(3)(a)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> has the potential, if misused, to upset the balance underpinning separation of powers. This argument is extremely powerful, but has been well-rehearsed, and there is no need to delve into it once again.</p>

<p>Instead, it is submitted that there is an additional important reason for favouring the approach English law has of ‘keeping the powder dry’ – it ensures the immense normative power of human rights law is retained. Put simply, human rights law is at its most powerful when it is not overused. This is best demonstrated by Section 4 HRA, the power to issue declarations of incompatibility. The Section could not be clearer about the fact that it has no effect on any legislation to which it is applied as a matter of law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Despite this, however, by mid-2015, twenty Section 4 declarations had been finalised, and nineteen of those had resulted directly in a change in the law. The reason for this is simple – Section 4 declarations represent a legal pronouncement that a piece of legislation is in breach of human rights, and that is a statement that carries an enormous amount of political weight. This political weight comes from the fact that human rights law has enormous normative power, which, to no small degree, comes from the scarcity and rarity of its use.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> It is not hard to see that, if declarations of incompatibility were an everyday occurrence, they would quickly lose their effect, as the ‘shock factor’ inherent in a court pronouncing the existence of a human rights violation would quickly dissipate. The same can be said for human rights law as an overall discipline – in order for it to maintain its normative power, it must be seen as a corpus of law to which recourse is only necessary in extreme situations. Of course, no attempt is made here to suggest that Mann J’s approach would have resulted in the demise of human rights law as a discipline, and in the value of Section 4 declarations – such a conclusion would be extraordinarily melodramatic. However, it is maintained that the normative power of the HRA is a vital component of its success, and that the best way to maintain this power is to ensure it is not overused – to keep its powder dry. The Court of Appeal has recognised this in <em>Fearn</em> and is to be commended for so doing.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Yeon’s suggestion that Mann J’s approach in the High Court in <em>Fearn</em> is “correct and appropriately restrained” is, it is submitted, simply not correct, either as a matter of precedent, or as a question of more general approach. As a matter of precedent, it runs contrary to established lines of authority from the highest level as regards horizontal effect under the HRA, and more generally, it goes against an established trend in HRA adjudication to ensure that, where possible, the HRA’s powder is kept dry. It is further submitted that this approach to the horizontal effect question is also defensible, for well-rehearsed but sound constitutional reasons, but also in order to ensure that the HRA’s normative power is maintained. Thus, for all these reasons, the approach of the Court of Appeal in <em>Fearn</em> is to be commended, as consistent, principled and, above all, restrained.</p>

	     <h5 id="introduction">Introduction:</h5>

<p>In the case of <em>R(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> the Supreme Court ruled that the Lord Chancellor’s Fee Orders for the Employment Tribunal (ET) and the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) were unlawful because they limited access to justice. This article will first set out the background facts and context behind the appeal. Then, it will highlight the shift in focus away from EU law to the common law in the Supreme Court judgment (“Judgment”). Finally, it will analyse the Judgment and discuss the common law’s potential to protect basic rights.  </p>

<h5 id="background-facts">Background facts:</h5>

<p>Section 42(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (‘2007 Act’) provides that the Lord Chancellor ‘may by order prescribe fees payable in respect of anything dealt with by the First-tier and Upper Tribunals or by an added tribunal.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> An “added tribunal” is defined by Section 42(3) as a tribunal specified in an order made by the Lord Chancellor.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> In 2013, through an order, the ET and EAT were included as added tribunals.</p>

<p>In July 2013, the Lord Chancellor introduced the Fee Order to make provisions for fees to be payable in respect of any claim presented to the ET and EAT. Before the Fee Order was made, access to the ETs, unlike claims in the ordinary courts, could be presented for free. The amount payable varied depending on the type of claim presented and whether it was brought by a single claimant or a group. The two types of claims are split up into “type A” and “type B” respectively. Type A claims require little to no pre-hearing work and are easy and quick to resolve. Meanwhile, type B claims generally involve more judicial time, for example equal pay claims and unfair dismissal claims. As established by the order, the fees for a single claimant was £390 for a “type A” claim and £1,200 for a “type B” claim. In the EAT, fees of £1,600 are payable. Claimants and appellants could only seek remission of fees after satisfying two criteria. First, their disposable capital must be below a specified amount. Second, if this test was satisfied, then the amount of any remission was qualified by the applicant’s gross monthly income. The threshold for access to remission varied depending on certain factors, for example: whether the claimant is single and whether they have children. The only other exception for remission was if the Lord Chancellor was satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances which justified such deviation.</p>

<p>UNISON sought judicial review over the Fee Order scheme on the basis that it unlawfully prevented or restricted access to justice. The claim was first brought on the grounds that the Fee Order was indirectly discriminatory and breached the EU law principles of effectiveness and equivalence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> The Divisional Court dismissed the claim on the basis that the proceedings were premature and lacked sufficient evidence to sustain the challenge.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> The Court of Appeal dismissed the judgment on the grounds that the imposition of a fee would not constitute an interference with the right of effective access to a tribunal under EU law unless it made it impossible in practice to access the tribunal.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> UNISON then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h5 id="a-shift-in-focus">A shift in focus:</h5>

<p>Before discussing the judgment, it is important to point out the shift in focus which the argument took as it proceeded from the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Before the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal, the issue of the Fee Order’s effect on access to justice was challenged on the basis of EU law. Before the Supreme Court, although some reference was made to EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, it was recognized that as part of the UK’s common law constitution, there was a right of access to justice. The shift in focus from EU law to common law in <em>UNISON</em> is an ample reminder that even with rights guaranteed from EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights, the common law remains a source of constitutional rights. When the Human Rights Act was first introduced, the sole focus from the judiciary on the European Convention on Human Rights compromised the common law’s development and ‘left it in the cupboard.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Only recently have judges brought back the common law as a guarantor of basic rights. As Lord Reed illustrated in <em>Osborn v Parole Board,</em> which concerned the right to a fair hearing,one should not ‘suppose that because an issue falls within the ambit of a Convention guarantee, it follows that the legal analysis of the problem should begin and end with Strasbourg case law.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The focus by the Court on the common law was likely deliberate. The Judgment was handed down after the UK voted to leave the European Union and amid political hostility towards the European Convention on Human Rights. It is in this context that the Judgment illuminates the common law’s potential as a guarantor of basic rights.</p>

<h5 id="the-supreme-courts-judgment">The Supreme Court’s judgment:</h5>

<p>In order to determine the extent of the power conferred on the Lord Chancellor by the 2007 Act, the court must consider both the text of the provision and the constitutional principles that underlie the text. Lord Reed noted that there are two important principles in this case to determine whether the Fee Order was unlawful under English law. First, the constitutional right of access to justice. Second, the rule that ‘specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>In English law, the right of access to the courts has been established since Magna Carta: ‘We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Applied to modern contexts, there are many examples where the judiciary has recognized the constitutional right of access to the courts, which can only be curtailed by clear statutory enactment by Parliament. As Lord Diplock remarked in <em>Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd,</em> ‘the due administration of justice requires <em>first</em> that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> In accordance with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, access to the courts should only be impeded through primary legislation from Parliament.</p>

<p>In principle, as Lord Reed noted, it can be justified for the executive to impose fees upon litigants. The imposition of fees is desirable because it transfers away costs from the general taxpayer to those that use the system. Moreover, a price mechanism could incentivise settlement and prevent weak claims from being pursued. However, in the context of the 2007 Act, Parliament did not expressly authorise the prevention of access to the relevant employment tribunals. As such, the fees imposed can only be justified if they do not lead to a <em>real risk</em> that persons will effectively be prevented from having access to justice. The court held that the present fee order imposed by the Lord Chancellor was not justifiable for five reasons. First, the Review Report on the impact of the fee orders concluded that the imposition of fees resulted in a ‘sharp, substantial and sustained fall in the volume of cases.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Second, the court was not comforted by the presence of the Lord Chancellor’s discretionary power of remission or by the statutory scheme. The effects of the Fee Order had occurred despite the existence of both remission avenues. The problems identified through the report and in the proceedings indicated a systemic issue.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Third, for low to middle income households to meet the expenses, they would need to sacrifice ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Fourth, many claims brought in front of the ETs do not seek any financial award. The claims which do seek a financial award are generally quite modest, for example £500 for unlawful deduction of wages. If a litigant had to pay £390 in order to pursue a claim worth £500, they would only sensibly do so if they were virtually certain of success. In practice, there is never a guarantee of success when pursuing a claim. Thus, the onerous fees would ‘render it futile or irrational to bring a claim.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> The evidence before the court suggested that only half of the claimants who succeeded in obtaining an award received payment in full, and around a third received nothing.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Finally, the Lord Chancellor did not set the prices at an optimal level to maximize revenue and failed to consider the public benefits derived from the enforcement of rights before the Employment Tribunals.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> All of the reasons above led to the conclusion that the Fee Orders effectively prevented access to justice and was therefore unlawful. Given that the Fee Order was unlawful under domestic law, the other arguments presented were dealt with very briefly in the judgment. </p>

<h5 id="discussion">Discussion:</h5>

<p>On doctrinal grounds, the Judgment was reached using well-established common law principles of judicial review. The Supreme Court merely applied the test established in <em>Hillingdon</em>: whether the Fee Order was ultra vires depended on whether there was a ‘real risk’ that litigants would effectively be prevented from having access to the court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> When reviewing this judgment, it must be emphasised that in <em>UNISON</em> the primary legislation contained no words authorizing the prevention of access to justice. However, Lord Reed, relying on the cases of <em>Leech</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> and <em>Daly</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> also suggested in obiter that even where primary legislation was concerned, the imposition of an intrusion on the right of access to justice is subject to a presumed implied limitation: the intrusion ‘must not be greater than is justified by the objectives which the measure is intended to serve.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> If this limitation was applied to primary legislation, it would appear to be a radical step in well-established principles of judicial review. As suggested by Murkens, ‘the real test would be if Parliament re-enacted the tribunal fees as an Act of Parliament.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> In <em>UNISON, Leech</em> and <em>Daly,</em> the judicial review challenge was not against primary legislation, but orders and rules made by the executive. Therefore, the three judicial review challenges relied upon well-established principles of judicial review against the executive. However, if the implied limitation is used in practice concerning primary legislation by Parliament, the courts would be embarking on an unprecedented step against the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. </p>

<p>The judgment should be applauded for the robust defence of access to the courts in maintaining the rule of law. Access to the courts is important for the rule of law because ‘without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The truth is that access to courts and tribunals are not just of value to individual litigants, but also to society. Every decision made by courts and tribunals contributes to the establishment of legal principles that applies to everyone. The courts and tribunals across the UK represent an avenue for litigants to enforce their rights. If a party or business fails to meet their obligation, a litigant should be able to seek a remedy against them. This ability to hold the other party to account is particularly important for relationships that are inherently unequal, such as the employer-employee relationship. In the context of employment tribunals, the mere fact that a claim can be brought by an employee will ensure that employers respect the rights provided by Parliament. If onerous fees prevent employees from making claims, employers could potentially disregard rights knowing that they will not be held to account before a court or tribunal.   </p>

<p>Finally, the judgement demonstrates clearly the potential of the common law to protect the right of access to justice, but what about other rights? The first difficulty encountered by the common law as a guarantor of basic rights is that it lacks an established list of constitutional rights. Although, extra-judicially, Lord Cooke included among the list of common law rights: the right of access to a court and to confidential legal advice, the right to a fair trial, the right to equal treatment, and the freedoms of expression and religion;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> as illustrated by Masterman and Wheatle, there ‘remains no complete list of rights which the common law ranks as constitutional.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> In addition, there are some fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights that are missing from Lord Cooke’s list of common law rights.  The right to private and family life provided by Article 8 and the right to freedom of assembly and association provided by Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights are notably absent among others. The weakness of domestic judicial review in protecting rights was noted by the European Court of Human Rights in <em>Smith and Grady v UK.</em> In the context of Article 8, despite the ‘anxious scrutiny’ test being applied where fundamental rights were concerned, the European Court of Human Rights still felt that the threshold for the domestic approach was so high that it was unable to provide adequate protection.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Although <em>UNISON</em> demonstrates that the common law can be an adequate guarantor of the right to access of justice, it is important to note that the right being protected in <em>UNISON</em> has a long history of receiving strong judicial protection. Therefore, the impact of the judgment in highlighting the common law’s ability to protect all rights should not be overstated. It is regrettable that the Court did not comment on the common law’s standard of review for other fundamental rights.As a result, the common law’s ability to guarantee other rights, particularly those less well-established, remains precarious. Whether the common law can adapt and evolve to protect other rights currently recognized under the Convention will be thrust into the spotlight if the UK departs from the European Convention on Human Rights in the future.  </p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h5>

<p>The judgment in <em>UNISON</em> clearly displays the potential for the common law as an instrument to protect basic rights. In this aspect, it continues the narrative driven by the Court in <em>Osborn</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> and <em>Kennedy</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> which highlighted the common law’s protection of the right to a fair hearing and the principle of open justice. In <em>UNISON</em>, the Supreme Court offered a robust defence of the importance of access to justice. However, the judgment leaves open two important questions. First, whether implied limitations apply to primary legislation made by Parliament. Second, despite the Supreme Court demonstrating that the common law will go to lengths to uphold the right of access to justice, it leaves open for discussion whether the common law can also be a powerful defender of other rights.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><strong>Would becoming a republic be so simple?</strong></p>

<p><em>Following the Prime Minister’s decision to prorogue Parliament, some Labour MPs have called for the UK to become a republic. This article will outline the possible forms a republic could take and explore the constitutional implications having an elected Head of State would cause. It is argued that the introduction of a President would radically change the UK’s constitutional setup and should be seen with scepticism.</em></p>

<p>Brexit is, once again, testing our uncodified constitution. The Prime Minister’s decision to advise the Queen to prorogue Parliament, which was given effect by an Order in Council, has been challenged in both the High Court and the Court of Session. Critics argue that the decision to suspend Parliament, mere weeks before the UK’s planned exit from the EU on October 31st 2019, is unconstitutional. The Government, in reply, argues that this unduly long parliamentary session should be brought to a close, so that it can bring forward a new legislative programme in the Queen’s Speech. The Supreme Court has since held that the prorogation was unlawful.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> This article will focus on a different but related matter. Some Labour MPs have argued that, since the Queen is constitutionally bound to follow the advice of her ministers, in this case their advice to prorogue Parliament, the country would be better suited having an elected Head of State. This article will explore some of the constitutional questions that the UK could face if it were to follow these MPs’ suggestion and abolish the monarchy. Moreover, it will be argued that the creation of Presidential role would either radically change the constitutional setup of the UK or be superfluous.</p>

<p>The first matter that must be considered if the monarchy is abolished is how its successor would be chosen. One option would be to hold a general election, which is the method of electing the President of Ireland.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> Alternatively, a special electoral body could be created, with its membership being drawn from Parliament and the devolved legislatures, similar to the German Federal Convention (<em>Bundesversammlung</em>).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> The method of electing the President is important as it would give some indication as to what type of powers this office would hold and, more importantly, how the holder would be expected to use them. Whilst technically the Queen has considerable power through the prerogatives, the day to day use of these powers is handled by her ministers. A President that is elected  by the people directly through contested elections could be expected to have a greater degree of freedom over the use of those powers than one that was chosen through other methods. Their position would be in stark contrast to a hereditary monarchy. Certainly, no one would be able to claim a directly elected President lacks a democratic mandate. They would be the only national directly elected figure in the country. It should be noted that even the German President does have discretion over the use of their powers, despite the lack of a direct election, although they exercise it with great caution.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Given the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended, it is submitted that a direct election would be the preferable model for the UK to follow, as opposed to adopting the German method. This ensures that all parts of the UK have a say in the choice of the President, not merely the countries with a functioning devolved legislature. The Labour MPs who have recently suggested the idea of a republic would seem to want the President not to be beholden to the Prime Minister, presumably in the hope that an elected Head of State would not have given the order to prorogue Parliament. Thus, a President who is able to have at least some discretion over the use of their powers is clearly envisaged. The desirability of the President having this freedom will be discussed below.</p>

<p>The leading campaign group in the UK in favour of abolishing the monarchy, Republic, describes on their website their suggestion for how a President would exercise their powers. What is immediately clear is that their solutions go beyond simply removing the monarch and replacing it with an identical elected figure; they are proposing radical changes to the existing constitutional framework. The President would not simply be ceremonial but would have the power to compel politicians to conform to a new codified constitution.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> Republic envisage the President presiding over the nomination of a new Prime Minister during a hung Parliament as well as speaking out on important issues of the day.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> By contrast, the Queen does not become involved in choosing the new Prime Minister herself, instead relying on the advice of ministers and is expected to remain silent and neutral on all political issues. They would also be able to use their limited powers according to certain official criteria, presumably laid out in the new constitution.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a>  This marks a fundamental break with the current constitutional arrangement. The desirability (or lack of) a codified constitution for the UK need not be considered here, it suffices to say it opens its own Pandora’s Box of constitutional issues.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> What does concern us now is that under this arrangement, the role of the President goes beyond that which the Queen currently has. No longer would the use of prerogatives rest upon the sole judgment of the Prime Minister. Depending upon how this new constitution is formulated, the President might be able to interfere with decisions we have come to expect to rest with the Prime Minister. Authorising military force or appointing ministers does not require Parliamentary approval, but the President could for example refuse to authorise military action unless the Commons voted in favour. Theresa May explicitly refused to seek a Commons vote over airstrikes in Syria but was able to authorise military action through the prerogative powers.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> This would mark a dramatic shift of power from the Prime Minister to the President. It would create a division of executive power that currently does not exist. The potential for conflict between the President and Prime Minister is obvious, especially if they belong to different political parties. It cannot be assumed that the party who is able to form a majority in the Commons would also win a Presidential election. Under the first past the post electoral system, a political party does not need to win a majority,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> or even a plurality of votes to form a Government.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> If, as regional mayors are elected, a runoff system with transferable votes is used to elect a President, which requires a majority of votes to be elected, it is possible that the President and Prime Minister could belong to different political parties. Even if the President was chosen by representatives from the devolved legislatures and Parliament, given that the largest political party in each body is different, it cannot be assumed the President would always belong to the same party as the Government.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> A key advantage of the UK’s current constitutional setup is its efficiency. The Government enjoys the support of the Commons and is able to pass legislation with relative ease to enact the policies it was elected on and can use the prerogative powers as it sees fit. Introducing a new powerful position could impede that process. It is submitted that such a change should be treated with great caution. It would create a powerful new constitutional figure who could, and likely would, challenge the Prime Minister’s authority.</p>

<p>Supporters of a powerful Presidential role may argue that the Prime Minister lacks sufficient scrutiny. Since they command a Commons majority, they (usually) have little difficulty winning votes. Thus, the separation of executive powers might be welcomed. However, this overlooks some features of the current constitutional arrangement. Firstly, Prime Ministers do face defeats in the Commons. The legislature is not entirely beholden to the executive and through defeating the Government in votes in the Commons acts as a check on their power. David Cameron was forced to abandon plans for airstrikes in Syria after failing to win a Commons vote on the matter. Whilst he still had the power to authorise military action, the political realities of the defeat prevented him from doing so.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> More fundamentally, it has become an understanding of the UK constitution that for as long as the Government can command a majority, it can exercise the prerogatives at its discretion. The Commons always retains the power to bring down a government that abuses these powers. Section 2 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 lays out the procedure for passing a no confidence motion, which, if successful, can lead to a general election. Whilst the party whipping system means that the likelihood of a MP voting against their own party in government is low, as the current Brexit crisis has shown, MPs have expressed their willingness to do so if they feel the Government is abusing their powers, even if this means losing their party whip.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> In the argument for a powerful President, one should not ignore the fact that the Commons already retains the power to act as a check on the Government.</p>

<p>There are at least three alternative arrangements to a President who is able to use their powers in the way described above. Firstly, one could simply elect a President but with the clear understanding, either in statute or by constitutional convention, that they will simply follow the Prime Minister’s advice when exercising the prerogative powers. In essence, it would be the same system as now, but with an elected Head of State rather than a hereditary one. This would prevent the friction between the Prime Minister and the President. However, one needs to question the point of this. Their role would be simply ceremonial. There is a political question as to whether there is a point in electing someone to do the role the Queen currently does. Moreover, it would not appease the Labour MPs who have recently suggested a republic, as it would mean the President would exercise the perogatives in the same way the Queen currently does, in obedience with the Prime Minister’s instructions.</p>

<p>There is middle path of the powers of the Presidency that they could only intervene in cases where fundamental values and rights are at stake. Thus, there would not be the interference by the President in day to day affairs of Government. This is based on the notion that the Presidency would have some democratic mandate. This model should be rejected. The scope of what would fall into this rights category is intolerably unclear. Does this only include the rights protected in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), or other issues such as socio-economic rights? If the former, the Human Rights Act 1998 already gives the courts ample powers to protect such rights,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> thus rendering the President’s power superfluous. Moreover, it is constitutional more appropriate for the courts to decide these matters since they are a better arbiter of what constitutes a breach of the ECHR than a President. If the President were allowed to intervene on a broader understanding of rights, the scope for intervention is indeterminable. A President may conclude that healthcare or education reforms fall under this remit. Ultimately, the courts would likely have to intervene to set the limits of Presidential power.</p>

<p>The third option would be to combine the roles of Head of State and Government. The Prime Minister could embody both. Since the use of prerogative powers already <em>de facto</em> rests with the Prime Minister, this would not be such a radical change. The only question that would need to be resolved is how the Prime Minister is appointed. Formally, the Sovereign appoints the person who can command the support of the Commons as Prime Minister. There would need to be a mechanism for appointing a new Prime Minister after a general election, resignation, or a vote of no confidence. Two options present themselves. Either the outgoing Prime Minister could appoint the person who would succeed them i.e. the leader of the party who has just won the election, or their own successor in their party. However, this might be politically unfashionable as it would mean leaders of opposite parties would have to appoint their rivals as Prime Minister e.g. an outgoing Conservative leader would have to appoint a Labour leader as Prime Minister. This issue is particularly troubling during hung Parliaments, such as the present, with a high chance of a successful no confidence motion. Section 2(3)(b) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 allows for two weeks after a successful motion of no confidence for a confidence motion to pass, either restoring the existing government or installing a new one A Prime Minister who has just lost this vote might be tempted to refuse to appoint a successor, instead pressing for an election. Such a move has been suggested by Boris Johnson. There is an alternative mechanism which could avoid this problem. At the start of a new Parliament after an election, or during the two weeks after a successful no confidence vote, Parliament could pass a motion proclaiming the new Prime Minister with that person immediately being installed. It would be Parliament who exercises the power to appoint the Prime Minister, rather than the Head of State. For example, if Boris Johnson were to be defeated in a vote of no confidence and the Commons passed a confidence motion in another leader, such as Jeremy Corbyn, the latter would immediately become the Prime Minister. This method would remove the responsibility of the outgoing Prime Minister to name their successor. Moreover, this would give a clear indication that they can command the confidence of the House of Commons and in the majority of cases, it would be a mere formality. Usually one party will command a majority in the Commons, either by themselves or with an arrangement with smaller parties, and they would be able to pass a motion naming their party leader as Prime Minister. A statute would need to be passed to transfer the power of appointing the Prime Minister from the executive to Parliament. As the House of Lords decided in <em>AG v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel</em>, if a statute replaces the prerogative then the prerogative is put in abeyance and the statutory scheme has to be used.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Neither of these solutions would not be a radical departure from the current system, as the Queen does not choose herself who to appoint, but rather faces the realities of the Parliamentary mathematics. However, this arrangement would not satisfy the Labour MPs. Control of the prerogatives would still have been under the Prime Minister’s control.</p>

<p>In light of the Supreme Court’s decision, finding against the Government on the lawfulness of the prorogation, the need for an elected Head of State is somewhat weakened. The courts have shown that they are willing and able to hold the executive to account over the use of prerogative powers. Whilst the political use of the powers still lies with the Prime Minister, which under a Presidential system they may not, the courts will ensure they are used legally. The question remains whether a second political actor to act as a check on the Prime Minister is desirable.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the debate over whether the UK should transform into a republic is a political question. What this article has sought to sketch is some of the legal difficulties and questions the UK would face if it were ever to abolish the monarchy. It is doubtful whether it would be simple for the current constitutional arrangement to be translated into a republican format. The  creation of a Presidential role, that would have been able to refuse Johnson’s wish to prorogue Parliament, could have unintended consequences further down the line. If, as is more likely, the Sovereign was replaced with a President, it is doubtful they would maintain the same subservient role the monarchy plays to the Prime Minister. Their democratic legitimacy would likely mean they would engage in day to day politics, particularly in divisive issues such as Brexit. Such a marked change to the current constitution presents a real danger of creating constitutional crisis over conflicts between the President and Prime Minister that could not arise under the current system.</p>

	     <p><strong>Commentary on <em>Lungowe and others v Vedanta Resources plc and Kokola Copper Mines plc</em> [2019] UKSC 20<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></strong></p>

<p>The need to secure individual human rights from corporate malpractice is of increasing importance in recent years in light of industrial incidents causing considerable injury to individuals and damage to properties and the environment.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> The UK Supreme Court’s recent decision in <em>Lungowe v Vedanta Resources plc and Kokola Copper Mines plc</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> commented as “the most important judicial decision in the field of business and human rights since the jurisdictional ruling of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum</em> in 2013,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> is the latest entry on the English jurisprudence on the protection of human rights against corporate abuses and malpractices. Although formally a jurisdictional ruling, it has provided important insights on how English courts will assess whether a defendant corporation(s) has breached its duty of care to the relevant claimants. A duty of care owed by a private company, despite being a private law matter, has considerable implications for the necessary human rights protection that the law should offer in favour of stakeholders affected by corporate malpractices. An example of this would be a fundamental human right to health.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> This article will focus on two issues: (i) the Supreme Court’s (“<strong>the Court</strong>”) approach to determining the existence of a duty of care owed by a corporation to others and breaches of such duty, and (ii) the approach to determining the proper forum for suing an anchor defendant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> It argues that the Court’s approach to finding the existence of a duty of care is commendable but potentially analytically confusing. Similarly, concerning the Court’s approach to the determination of the proper forum in the present context, it argues that the Court’s approach improves the ability of the assessment to be tailored closer to the facts, but the cost of less predictable application of the law.</p>

<h5 id="facts-and-appellate-history">Facts and appellate history</h5>

<p>From Chingola in Zambia, 1,826 people claimed that Vedanta Resources plc (“<strong>Vedanta plc</strong>”) (an English holding company with a small office in London but controlled a huge amount of assets) breached its duty of care to ensure that its Zambian subsidiary (Konkola Copper Mines plc (“<strong>KCM plc</strong>”); biggest private employer in Zambia but had few assets of its own) would not harm the environment surrounding its mining sites and local communities. The claimants claimed compensation for personal injury, property damage, loss of income, amenity and enjoyment of land because of discharges from copper mines. In response, Vedanta plc and KCM plc argued that the English courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim and the proceedings should be stayed on <em>forum non conveniens</em> grounds. At the first instance,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Coulson J granted jurisdiction over the claims and held that the case could not be fairly pursued in Zambia.</p>

<p>At the Court of Appeal,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> Simon LJ (with whom Jackson LJ and Asplin LJ agreed with) confirmed that the foreign citizens may pursue legal claims in England against English-based multinational companies for their overseas activities. On the claims, Simon LJ summarised the following principles at [83] about the determination of the existence of a duty of care owed by a parent company of a multinational corporation:-</p>

<p>● The starting point is the three-part test of foreseeability, proximity, and reasonableness from the seminal tort case of <em>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>● A duty of care may be owed by a parent company to an employee of a subsidiary, or a party directly affected by the operations of that subsidiary. Such duty of care may arise where the company (a) has taken direct responsibility for devising a material health and safety policy the adequacy of which is the subject of the claim, or (b) controls the operations which give rise to the claim.</p>

<p>Simon LJ also held that England and Wales was the proper place to bring trial, and defended Coulson J’s decision as he was “entitled to view that it was inappropriate for the litigation to be conducted in parallel proceedings involving identical or virtually identical facts, witnesses and documents, in circumstances where the claim against Vedanta would in any event continue in England.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Considerable emphasis was laid on a need to avoid similar proceedings in two jurisdictions. He further noted that if the claimants litigated against KCM plc in Zambia, they would not obtain justice for a number of reasons: (i) they would not be able to afford the cost of any legal representation even with their low levels of earnings in the first place,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> (ii) Condition Fee Agreements are unlawful in Zambia and thus the claimants could not avail of it,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> (iii) there was no prospect for the claimants to obtain legal aid,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> (iv) prospect of <em>ad hoc</em> funding was unrealistic,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> (v) no private lawyers with relevant experience were willing and capable of taking on such claims in Zambia,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> (vi) previous environmental litigations in Zambia had failed for various reasons,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> and (vii) KCM plc was likely to adopt an obdurate approach to litigation in Zambia thus resulting in an enormous increase of time and cost.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a></p>

<p>The appeal to the Supreme Court raised three questions on jurisdiction, two of which are relevant to the discussion on the Court’s approach to jurisdiction and <em>forum non conveniens</em>: (i) whether England and Wales was the proper place to bring the claims, and (ii) even if Zambia would otherwise be the proper place, whether there was a real risk that the claimants would not obtain access to substantial justice in Zambia.</p>

<h5 id="lord-briggss-contextualised-approaches">Lord Briggs’s contextualised approaches</h5>

<h6 id="parent-companys-duty-of-care"><u>Parent company's duty of care</u></h6>

<p>Holding that ownership of a subsidiary company by a parent company does not impose a duty to take control of the management of the operations or business owned by the subsidiary, Lord Briggs noted that “everything depends on the extent to which, and the way in which, the parent availed himself of the opportunity to take over, intervene in, control, supervise or advise the management of the relevant operations … of the subsidiary.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> The intervention of the English-domiciled parent companies in the management of subsidiaries’ operations and their human rights and environmental performance may give rise to a duty of care to third parties, for example local communities. The human rights of such third parties is thus indirectly protected by prudent, or at least well-planned, corporate practices. Instead of focusing only on the subsidiary company itself, both the parent and subsidiary companies will be required to contribute to prudent corporate practices and mitigate the detrimental impacts of corporate practices on e.g. local communities. The duty is, moreover, not merely limited to health and safety issues. Moving on, Lord Briggs also refused to compartmentalise and categorise the cases and scenarios under which a parent company would be liable. In light of the lack of any limitations to models of management, Lord Briggs was “reluctant to seek to shoehorn all cases of the parent’s liability into specific categories of that kind, helpful though they will no doubt be for the purposes of analysis.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a></p>

<p>Lord Briggs argued that the existence of group-wide policies and guidelines <em>per se</em> and the parent’s expectation on the subsidiary to comply with them is not sufficient for finding a duty of care. It is necessary for the parent company, instead of merely proclaiming such policies, to “take active steps, by training, supervision and enforcement, to see that they are implemented by relevant subsidiaries.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> Alternatively, a parent company may incur a duty of care to a third party if, in its published materials, “[the company] holds itself out as exercising that degree of supervision and control of its subsidiaries, even if it does not in fact do so.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> In such circumstances, the parent company’s omission from acting may constitute an abdication of the responsibility which it has publicly undertaken. The published materials of Vedanta plc was held to show that the company had “asserted its own assumption of responsibility for the maintenance of proper standards of environmental control over the activities of the subsidiaries, and in particular the operations of the Mine … to show that it is well arguable that a sufficient level of intervention by Vedanta in the conduct of operations at the Mine may be demonstrable at trial…“<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<h6 id="forum-non-conveniens-and-proper-place-for-trial"><u>*Forum non conveniens* and proper place for trial</u></h6>

<p>For the Respondents to persuade the Court to decline jurisdiction on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, two requirements must be satisfied:<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> (i) they need to show that the foreign forum is “clearly more appropriate,” and (ii) “substantial justice” will be done at the foreign form – stay of proceedings will not be granted in favour of the defendant if “substantial justice” will not be done at the foreign forum. Firstly, under (i), in contrast to Coulson J’s and Simon LJ’s analysis based on the need to avoid parallel proceedings and judgements, Lord Briggs argued that the purpose of avoiding irreconcilable judgements should be balanced against other connecting factors which link the case with the foreign forum. As Vedanta plc had consented to submit to the jurisdiction of Zambian courts, the choice of the forum of litigation now enjoyed by the claimants renders the possibility of irreconcilable judgements no longer a decisive or conclusive answer to the question of the appropriateness of forum.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> This is because it becomes possible for both parties to agree to litigate in Zambian courts. Coulson J’s determination on this point is thus an error of principle.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> Lord Briggs then moved on to note that, while the risk of irreconcilable judgements was a relevant factor and contoured against holding Zambia as the proper forum, the other connecting factors in the present case showed that Zambia was “the overwhelmingly the proper place for the claim to be tried.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> In such an assessment, “it is sensible to stand back and look at the matter in the round.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a></p>

<p>Moving on to the second limb of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> test, for the court to exercise discretion and permit English proceedings, it is necessary to satisfy the court “…by cogent evidence … there is a real risk that substantial justice will not be obtainable in that foreign jurisdiction.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> Lord Briggs found in favour of the claimant that substantial justice will not be done if the claim was pursued in Zambia, the key issue being the lack of funding. While there existed various forms of funding, it was found that “most were unavailable but that the one which was in principle available would not attract a legal team which was both prepared to act, and able to do so with the requisite resources and experience.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> The need for expert evidence and work in the present case, from the legal team representing the claimants, be “paid for as disbursements, but it will still need to be supervised by competent and experienced lawyers.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> The “unavoidable scale and complexity of this case (wherever litigated)”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> has led the judge to conclude, correctly in Lord Briggs’s opinion, that in light of the limited funding and legal resources available within Zambia, substantial justice could not be achieved in Zambian courts.</p>

<h5 id="implications-of-lungowe-and-future-developments">Implications of <em>Lungowe</em> and future developments</h5>

<h6 id="parent-company-liabilities"><u>Parent company liabilities</u></h6>

<p>To begin with, Lord Briggs’s judgement of the existence of a duty of care owed by parent companies is an important step towards enhancing corporate accountability for human rights violations. The contextualised approach at [49] focusing on the extent of intervention by the parent company into the subsidiary’s operations allow for a more accurate assessment of the actual scope of liability that should be borne by the parent. This is because the “human rights” under consideration in the present case are likely to be, in contrast to the fundamental rights found in the e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> of a socio-economic character. An example mentioned at the start of this article is a right to health under Article 12 of the International Convention on Economics, Social and Cultural Rights. This would be particularly important for countries like Zambia, a third-world country in a developing status and the nation’s social-economic infrastructure and rights protection are not as robust as first-world countries. Instead of imposing any direct judicial standards on the requisite standard of duty of care to be satisfied, Lord Briggs’s judgement has struck a delicate balance between the need to maintain (i) the need for autonomy and flexibility in corporate practices and (ii) the need for judicial oversight in monitoring multinational companies and their practices, in particular the subsidiaries, in less-developed countries across the globe.</p>

<p>Another point to note is the open-ended nature of the scope of liability borne by parent companies. It should be seen as an improvement from the seminal Court of Appeal case of <em>Chandler v Cape plc</em> in 2012.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> In <em>Chandler</em>, Arden LJ laid down four requirements to be satisfied in order for the court to impose on a parent company responsibility for the health and safety of its subsidiary’s employees.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> Arden LJ’s approach was more restrictive than Lord Briggs’s formulation for two reasons. Firstly, the <em>Chandler</em> duty of care only focused on the health and safety policies of the subsidiary company, instead of the general management of the “relevant operations” of the subsidiary. Lord Briggs’s formulation allows for a more expansive range of policies and practices to be covered in assessing whether the parent company should be adjudged to owe a duty of care to the relevant parties. The court enjoys a “broad supervisory spectrum”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> in monitoring the policies and practices of the multinational corporation, based on the instructions of the parent company, as a whole. Secondly, and more importantly, Lord Briggs’s approach is not limited to the employees of the subsidiary company, but may include third parties affected by the corporation’s operation, for example local communities. This expands the scope of accountability of the parent company, thus encouraging them to be more mindful of the possible consequences and implications of their practices on potential stakeholders related or relevant to its business operations.</p>

<p>As a matter of legal analysis, Lord Briggs’s judgement can be seen as a scale for determining whether a parent company should be held to have owed a duty of care to the relevant stakeholders, and thus whether it has breached its duty of care (as adjudged to have existed). This scale is based on the extent of participation and intervention into the subsidiary’s operations. This, however, gives rise to the possible scenario and incentive of a hands-off parent company permitting its subsidiary to commit human rights abuses for business purposes,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> yet to be adjudged to have not intervened sufficiently into the subsidiary’s operations and thus cannot be said to have owed any duty of care. Robert McCorquodale observes that this would undermine developments in human rights due diligence on the part of multinational corporations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Omission on the part of the parent company may, therefore, not be seen as a breach of duty of care (since there could not be any duty of care in the first place). This is particularly problematic for vulnerable third parties, for example local communities, that do not have adequate resources to protect their neighbourhood and natural resources from being damaged by the business operations of subsidiaries of multinational corporations.</p>

<p>A possible remedy for this loophole may be found in the requirements offered by Arden LJ in <em>Chandler</em>. It is worthy to note that Arden LJ formulated the parent company’s involvement in the subsidiary’s business operations as “has or ought to have.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> The “ought” part of the formulation is illuminating, as it allows the court to escape the analytical loophole mentioned in the foregoing paragraph and hold that the parent should have intervened in the first place. Instead of focusing on what the parent company has done or offered to do, the incorporation of Arden LJ’s analysis in Lord Briggs’s formulation could allow a court to find what the parent company should have done. This would also fit in nicely with Lord Briggs’s refusal to compartmentalise cases of parent’s liability at [50], as a type of case in which the parent should have asserted responsibility but nevertheless failed to. Alternatively, considerations over what the parent company should have done may be seen as an example of being “reasonable” to hold the company to have owed a duty of care under the <em>Caparo</em> test. Under Lords Brigg’s emphasis on the general management and operations of the subsidiary company, this may suggest that liability for omissions may encompass the parent company’s inaction in terms of ensuring that the subsidiary’s relevant management and operations would not be contrary to the human rights interests of stakeholders, in particular local communities and vulnerable individuals.</p>

<h6 id="forum-non-conveniens-and-proper-place-for-trial-1"><em><u>Forum non conveniens</u></em><u> and proper place for trial</u></h6>

<p>The continued application of the two-part test of <em>forum non conveniens</em> protects the legal and analytical certainty needed for such analysis. Such certainty is particularly crucial in the present context as it carries considerable implications on the proper role of a domestic court in deciding whether to intervene into a case which may be more appropriately held in a foreign court. The most important change brought by Lord Briggs’s judgement, it is submitted, is the diminished importance of the policy of avoiding parallel proceedings as a factor in determining the appropriate place for a trial involving an anchor defendant. On this point, Ekaterina Aristova argues that the policy of avoiding parallel proceedings had more force in the jurisdictional analysis of the judgement than the existence of any territorial connections between England and claims against the foreign subsidiary.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> What was not resolved in Lord Briggs’s judgement is, however, the actual importance and position of the factor of (risk of) irreconcilable judgements in the first limb of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> test (the “clearly more appropriate” component). This is because, despite connecting factors now being given primary (or at least increased) importance in the first limb of the test, it is unclear the extent to which the need to avoid parallel proceedings should be given weight. Given such an important change in the method of determining proper forum, Lord Briggs could have clarified the analytical flow in determining whether an English court is the proper forum for hearing cases like <em>Lungowe</em>.</p>

<p>The identification of proper forum also raises concerns about the future of litigating negligence claims against English-domiciled parent companies in English courts. Following <em>Lungowe</em>, English courts will not treat jurisdictional rules as decisive of the question of proper forum, but will focus more on the balance of connecting factors to determine where the proper forum for litigating claims against the foreign subsidiary is. This takes place in the final step of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> test - only after having determined that the impugned foreign court is the appropriate forum for the trial. The outcome of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> inquiry will now be dependent on the achievement of substantial justice in the foreign court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> It must not be ignored, however, that “substantial justice” was not given a comprehensive elaboration in terms of the possible scope of considerations that can arise under it. Putting such criticism to its strongest, “substantial justice” may be interpreted as a wild card for the court to grant English proceedings in order to allow claimants to avail themselves of the comprehensive English tort rules in pursuing claims against multinational corporations. That being said, it is submitted that Lord Briggs’s analysis is unlikely to be interpreted as such. This is because his analysis is, appropriately, focused on the need to ensure access to justice for the disadvantaged claimants. Given access to justice (in particular, right of access to courts) has always been one of the rights most cherished by English courts in common law,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> Lord Briggs’s focus on access to justice is a prudent formulation of what “substantial justice” should entail. The key should always be on the possibility of access to justice and allowing claimants to have their claims properly heard and assessed.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>The need to protect the human rights of stakeholders in the context of the business operations of multinational corporations presents a delicate challenge for the courts. Tasked with balancing the need for robust human rights protection and restraint from excessive judicial intervention in corporate practices and possible hearings in foreign forums, <em>Lungowe</em> has struck a commendable balance between the two. It has also presented a breath of fresh air on important questions of corporate accountability in private law, which has considerable implications on human rights protection indirectly offered by the court. Although a full assessment of Lord Briggs’s judgement cannot be conducted in the limited space of this commentary, it is clear that it represents an important step in enhancing human rights protection for stakeholders in business operations of multinational corporations across an increasingly globalised business environment.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>The tension between constituent power and a liberal theory of constitutionalism is important in constitutional theory as they paint very different perceptions of the nature of authority in a constitution. Constituent power is “the power through which the prince’s power to rule was authorised,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> and its primary function is to “specify in constitutional language the ultimate source of authority of the state.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> This article focuses on the work of Carl Schmitt, as it is suggested as a “powerful corrective to the distortions of normativism.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> It is clearly anti-liberal and decisionist, providing a direct ground for critical evaluation of the alleged tension. In a similar vein, calls for executive action and/or dominance in times of emergency or crisis renders it necessary to understand whether the assumption of (near) absolute power by the executive in such times entails the death of liberal constitutionalism.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> This article argues that the concept of constituent power is only anathema to liberal constitutionalism if their relationship is conceived as dichotomous without any mutually inclusive aspects. Three arguments will be made. Firstly, by analysing Schmitt’s conception of constituent power and its perceived contradistinctions against liberal constitutionalism, it will be shown that the relationship between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism is dichotomous only if constituent power is conceived as external to the legal order. It will then narrow down the focus to the issue of emergency, contending that it does not require the law to recede and be totally suspended, and the concept of constituent power can be reconciled with liberal constitutionalism. Last but not the least, using the recent rumors of the use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (Cap. 241) (“<strong>ERO</strong>”) by the Hong Kong Government to deal with various protests and clashes since early June 2019, it will be shown that limitations on the Executive’s power is crucial in order for Schmitt’s concept of constituent power and a liberal theory of constitutionalism to be reconciled. This article will come to the conclusion that Schmitt’s refusal to recognise the broader political and legal contexts underpinning the concept of constituent power is the main reason why it may be anathema to liberal constitutionalism.</p>

<p><strong>Schmitt’s unnecessarily dichotomous conception of the relationship between constituent power and a liberal theory of constitutionalism</strong></p>

<p>For Schmitt, the sovereign bears constituent power: “sovereign is he who decides on the exception,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> which cannot be derived solely from a general norm. It is a power which has the ultimate say in a political regime, unconstrained by any norms. His insistence on constituent power as the subject of a constitution denies the possibility of a closed, purely normative constitutional system.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> From this stance, it is unmistakable that Schmitt is antagonistic against a liberal theory of constitutionalism. The sovereign decision is the absolute beginning. His conception of constituent power is clearly anathema to liberal constitutionalism. Taken to its logical extreme, Schmitt’s conception of constituent power in <em>Political Theology</em> forms the basis for an “authoritarian exceptionless exception.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Based on the omnipotence of the sovereign, it has the absolute discretion to determine what “constitutes” an exception, without any constraints from any other parties, rules, or norms whatsoever. The untrammeled absolute power the sovereign enjoys here in determining what constitutes an exception and what to do with such “exception” illustrates the possibly endless power the sovereign may be said to possess.  This is an accurate observation as the exception which the sovereign decides on may be easily normalised as a daily occurrence. The power to authorise so is unchecked. The utilisation of extraordinary powers in cases of the now-normalised “exceptional” circumstances is antagonistic against a liberal constitutionalist’s propositions for checks and balances and rooting the foundation of extraordinary powers in a <em>legal</em> source.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to scrutinise Schmitt’s propositions, a liberal theory of constitutionalism should first be introduced. In contradistinction to Schmitt’s absolutist picture, Friedrich Hayek offers a remarkably liberal and norm-based theory of constitutionalism. For Hayek, the authority of a legislator should rest on something distinguished from “an act of will on a particular matter in hand.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> Such authority cannot rest solely upon the discretion of the legislator himself. Instead, such power “rests on a common opinion about certain attributes which the laws he produces ought to possess.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> The power must be shaped and/or contributed by such attributes, instead of stemming from any unpredictable and variable absolute discretion of a legislator. Moreover, there is no logical necessity that the ultimate power must be omnipotent. Such ultimate power is “a negative power, but as a power of withholding allegiance it limits all positive power.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> The ultimate authority authorising all actions of the government constraints the government’s actions. The only true side of law is <em>nomos</em>, and it should neither dictate nor direct the actions of the people. For Schmitt, the true side of law is <em>thesis</em> — the law of will: imposed organisation. Schmitt’s main attack on liberalism is based on the inevitable existence of the exception. There is no normative basis which it may be seen to rest or be constrained on.</p>

<p>What Schmitt fails to realise, however, is that his dichotomous conception of the relationship between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism has blinded him from the position the former has within the latter. Loughlin recognised<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a>  that for Schmitt, the significance of constituent power lies in the fact that the state continues to evolve, expressing “the principle of dynamic emergence of political unity, of the process of constantly renewed formation and emergence of this unity from a fundamental or ultimately effective power …”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Constituent power also expresses the formative process by which that sovereign will exhibits itself through time.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a>  Here is where Schmitt misses the point: the formative process of exhibition and decision-making can and necessarily have recourse to legal norms; there can be fundamental norms which the sovereign is subjected to. The <em>authorisation</em> from constituent power in terms of the decisions that can be adopted can nevertheless be subjected to liberal norms, such as the rule of law. For example, the collective autonomy of the people to uphold the rule of law can control the exercise of ultimate authority <em>for the purpose of</em> upholding the desired norms. Schmitt, however, only focused on the formation of the unity <em>itself</em>, but not the role of this unity in conferring power to the government. The formation of the unity and its authorisation of the ruler’s power are separate questions, but Schmitt’s conflation of them has blinded him from the possibility of liberal norms underpinning the authorisation of power. The collective autonomy of the people as vested in the ruler to make decisions does not have to be dichotomised with the norms that the community of people decides to uphold. From this lens, the exercise of constituent power is part of the liberal constitutional order. This gives crucial insight into the second inquiry of this article: the conception of constituent power in the context of emergency.</p>

<p><strong>The peaceful co-existence of constituent power and liberal constitutionalism in times of emergency</strong></p>

<p>The recent expanded uses of emergency power that suspend normal constitutional protections have rejuvenated interest on Schmitt’s distinction between the norm and exception as the analytical framework for relevant constitutional measures.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> For Schmitt, the exception can be “best characterised as a case of extreme peril…It cannot be circumscribed factually and made to conform to a preformed law.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> If actions in an emergency are not subject to controls, which a liberal theory of constitutionalism would require, it should become clear who the sovereign is.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> In order for the executive to respond to emergencies effectively, constituent power must be unlimited in authorising the range of responses it can offer, regardless of extremity. The exception is characterised by principally unlimited authority, entailing the suspension of the entire existing legal order: “the state remains, whereas the law recedes.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Constituent power gives unlimited authority for the ruler to do whatever he deems necessary: it is not subjected to controls of any sort. This contrasts with a liberal constitutionalist’s, for example Hayek, claim that such exercise of power should still be constrained. The key is to limit the power that <em>authorises</em> the government’s powers and actions.</p>

<p>The need to decide on the exception emphasises the central role of political decision-makers who decide on how to deal with it on a case-by-case basis. Schmitt’s conception of constituent power “denies that law’s authority can be found on the intrinsic qualities of legal order.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> His account, however, is flawed; by correcting this logical fallacy, the tension between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism can be resolved. To begin with, Dyzenhaus noted that Schmitt was unable to locate authority in something external because it is “drawn to claim that the basis is quasi-legal.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> This is reflected in Schmitt’s insistence for a normal situation to exist in order to determine whether the nation is still in a normal situation or it has entered into a state of emergency. In deciding so, the executive has to start from the norm, which delineates the normal situations of a constitutional order. This is because the power authorising the government’s power to make emergency measures has, at the very minimum, part of its basis in the norm <em>itself</em>. Without recourse to or starting from the general norm, the exception may become the norm itself, as it has nothing to be “exceptional” from. Given the necessary involvement of a “norm,” the concept of constituent power can therefore be reconciled with liberal constitutionalism. The power which authorises the executive to adopt emergency measures does not spring out from nowhere, but from the norm underpinning the normal situation as recognised by the liberal constitution. For example, for a liberal state to declare martial law, it is necessary for the power making the decision to enter into a state of emergency to find in the general norm situations or conditions which <em>allow</em> such state of emergency to be declared. The move from a state of normal law to martial law has to start with an examination of the normal law itself, and whether its inability to tackle the alleged emergency warrants exceptions to be made <em>to</em> the normal law.</p>

<p>However, to further rescue the concept of constituent power from Schmitt’s extreme stance, it is necessary to briefly examine his views on the influence of politics on law. Schmitt’s systematic thinking, in reducing the concept of the “political” to “friend” and “enemy,” has led him to conceive emergency, based on constituent power, as a “battering ram”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> against liberal democracy. His conception of law, that “all law is ‘situational law,’“<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> is “intrinsically bound up with a political struggle.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> Once the “struggle” of the exception triumphs over the normal situation, the latter is seen as “defeated;” the exception’s “victory” awards the executive an unlimited authorisation to enact emergency measures. It is questionable, however, whether the concept of “political” has to be reduced to “friend” and “enemy” in order to justify the application of emergency measures. As Scheuerman observes, Schmitt’s analysis of emergency government “neglects its complex political origins.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> It focuses excessively on the formation and constant renewal of the power <em>itself</em>, neglecting any common interests which competing concerns in politics may have or compromise on.  Here is where liberal constitutionalism can provide an answer: to safeguard the sustainability of the norms the liberal constitutional order is found on. Once the focus of constituent power is broadened to encapsulate the objectives of the authorising the use of emergency powers and “malleable recent social trends,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> instead of only pestering on the formation and history of constituent power itself, it may be re-conceptualised as the starting point for ending the exceptional situation and return to the normal order. Historical givens, despite providing a solid ground for a framework of exception, is inadequate. It tends to neglect the reasons for emergency and the objectives of emergency measures. The stakeholders within the “political” do not have to be dichotomised into an opposing relationship of friend and enemy.</p>

<p>Once the competing interests underlying norms and exceptions are no longer contradistinguished from one another in the Schmittian sense, constituent power can be reconciled with a liberal theory of constitutionalism in acknowledging the existence of mutually competing interests. No particular stance and interests would enjoy an absolute status over another. In order to reconcile with the concept of constituent power, liberal constitutionalists should view the state of emergency as “a crucial tool enabling public reassurance in the short run without creating long-run damage to foundational commitments to freedom and the rule of law.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> Constituent power, as the ultimate authority for the executive to act for the purpose of safeguarding commitments to liberal ideals, works alongside liberal constitutionalism to correct the state the exceptional situation and return it to normal.</p>

<p><strong>The Emergency Regulations Ordinance (Cap. 241)</strong></p>

<p>The ERO empowers the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to enact a wide but exhaustive range of regulations<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> “whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Any regulations made under section 2(2) would, moreover, be “continue in force until repealed by order of the Chief Executive in Council.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> Moreover, any regulations enacted under section 2(2) would “have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> When read together, sections 2(2) and 2(3) or 2(4) would suggest that unlimited power is bestowed upon the Chief Executive in the selected area(s) (s)he chooses to legislate on. Instead of being limited by any external restraints (say, for example, a judicial review action which, given the generality of the language under the ERO, is unlikely to succeed), the Chief Executive has unlimited power to legislate in any terms (s)he desires to be in the public interest. Moreover, the language of section 2(1) epitomises Schmitt’s conception of the exception. Instead of requiring any approval by any other institutional bodies, for example the Executive Council or the Legislative Council, the power to make regulations under section 2(1) only refers to the Chief Executive himself and himself only. This opens the possibility of a significant threat being posed to the liberties which citizens would ordinarily enjoy – in times of alleged emergency or public danger, civil liberties may be disregarded significantly (if not completely) and there are no executive or legislative checks against it.</p>

<p>Section 2(3) provides the only statutory method for terminating a regulation enacted under section 2(1) and 2(2) of the ERO. This means that the termination of any emergency regulation would, on a literal interpretation of the Ordinance, be at the absolute discretion of the Chief Executive in Council. Whilst any predictions to the Chief Executive’s use of the Ordinance is beyond the scope of this article, it is sufficient to note that the civil liberties of over seven million Hong Kong citizens would lie in her sole discretion. The lack of any principles or rules guiding the return to normalcy under the Ordinance further exposes the potential dangers to liberal constitutionalism posed by the Ordinance. Instead of being required to repeal any emergency regulations over a particular period of time, or inserting mandatorily such regulations with sunset clauses, the Ordinance provides no hints as to normalcy can and should be achieved (or returned to) once the emergency regulations are enacted. Any approaches to the Ordinance and the enactment of regulations must, for at least the purpose of restoring the stability and orderliness of the Hong Kong society, bear in mind the protection of a liberal constitutional order and the integrity of the legal system.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Constituent power is a powerful concept in illustrating the ultimate authority of the state and justifying the ruler’s authority to act. Schmitt’s wickedly ingenious illustration of the unlimitedness of the exception and its authority to respond to emergencies, whilst compelling, risks unnecessarily dichotomising the relationship between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism. Although a thorough examination of Schmitt’s conception and critique against it cannot be examined in the limited space of this article, it is clear that the concept of constituent power is not anathema to a theory of liberal constitutionalism: they can work together to uphold the liberal constitutional order, and safeguard it from falling into a permanent state of emergency.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>In the 1960s, there was talk of a ‘Fairness Revolution’ in English judicial review.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> One of the most pertinent cases exemplifying such a movement is  Anisminic.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> In that case, an administrative statutory body, the Foreign Compensation Commission, was given the job of deciding whether compensation should be awarded for property sequestrated as a result of the 1956 Suez crisis. This was empowered by section 4(4) of  the Foreign Compensation Act 1950,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> which provided that:</p>

<p>‘The determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<p>On the face of the provision, there seems to be very little, if any, room for judicial maneuver: if no ‘determination’ of the Foreign Compensation Commission could be ‘called in question’ by any court, then it is difficult to see what scope might remain for judicial review.</p>

<p>Yet, judges found their way around this seemingly exhaustive provision. Since any determination of the Commission should not be scrutinised by courts, judges would be able to do so only if it was found not to be a determination. So, the only way that they could enforce their constitutional role would be to prove that what the Commission called a ‘determination’ was not a real determination.</p>

<p>The question consequently turned to whether the Commission actually made a determination. To answer the question, they recalled an error of law that the Commission had committed made in misconstruing the eligibility criteria that had to be met for the claimant’s compensation. More specifically, when determining that the appellant did not qualify for compensation,  the majority considered that the Commission had gone outside its jurisdiction by basing  its decision on an inquiry into the nature of the appellant company which the legislation did not empower it to make.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>As such, what the Commission regarded as a ‘determination’ did not qualify as a determination for the courts – instead, they called it a ‘purported determination’, a ‘nullity’, because the Commission could not be held entitled to make procedurally unfair determinations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> The House of Lords concluded that the provision was not enough to oust judicial review for error of law.</p>

<p>Fast forward 50 years, and another similar case emerges, <em>Privacy International</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> The issue was whether the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), a body set up to review state surveillance decisions, was itself subject to judicial review in the ordinary courts. The case concerned the legal scope of s.68(7) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> which provided that:</p>

<p>‘determinations, awards, orders and other decisions of the Tribunal (including decisions as to whether they have jurisdiction) shall not be subject to appeal or be liable to be questioned in any court’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>In particular, the question was whether this provision constituted a successful attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear challenges to the decisions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal by judicial review.</p>

<p>In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, the case has come to be treated as an <em>Anisminic</em> 2.0.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Yet, it is significant to remember that the Court of Appeal decision had a different view, having marked the two cases as materially different.</p>

<p>Sales LJ found two differences. Firstly, there was a difference in the language used in the two provisions. This was because the drafter of section 67(8) had expressly referred to the possibility of the IPT making an error of law going to its jurisdiction or power to act, by the words in parentheses in that provision: ‘including decisions as to whether they have jurisdiction’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Therefore, at least so far as the word ‘decision’ was concerned, it was not tenable to apply the simple distinction relied upon in Anisminic in the context of section 4(4) of the 1950 Act between a determination and a purported determination, in the sense of a determination made without jurisdiction because of an error of law. Therefore, to use the jargon of <em>Anisminic</em>, section 67(8) applied to purported decisions, too.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a difference in the context of the two cases, since the provisions applied to different bodies. By contrast with <em>Anisminic</em>, the tribunal of <em>Privacy International</em> was of a judicial nature, already exercising a supervisory jurisdiction and power of judicial review over the actions of public authorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Furthermore, the legislation authorised the Secretary of State to create a right of appeal (although  that power had never been exercised).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Sales LJ also noted the very high quality of the IPT in terms of judicial expertise and independence,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> since to him, it was clear that Parliament’s intention in establishing the IPT and in laying down a framework for the special procedural rules which it should follow, was to set up a tribunal capable of considering claims against the intelligence services under closed conditions. The ultimate goal was to have complete assurance that there would not be disclosure of sensitive confidential information about their activities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are  counterpoints to both of those issues. On the first linguistic difference, an adequate response is given by Leggatt LJ, who while not formally dissenting, was ‘inclined’ to a different view. He thought that the case was governed by the reasoning in <em>Anisminic</em>, since the only potentially relevant difference in the wording of section 67(8) is that it contains the words in parentheses ‘(including as to whether they have jurisdiction)’. But he found it hard to see how these words could  make a critical difference in the light of <em>Anisminic</em>. This is because the decision in Anisminic was not concerned by its scope of jurisdiction, i.e. the tribunal was not found to make an error of law, because it made an error about the scope of its jurisdiction.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Rather, it decided that any determination based on an error of law, whether going to the jurisdiction of the tribunal or not, was not a ‘determination’ within the meaning of the statutory provision. Therefore, the question of jurisdiction emerges as irrelevant.</p>

<p>On the second contextual difference, we should first examine the policy justifications behind it. Sales LJ found the status of the tribunal significant, because he noted that if judicial review was to be allowed, then – and he went on to use a floodgates argument – it would be open to a claimant to allege that a decision had  been made, unsupported or contradicted by evidence, requiring the reviewing court to examine all the evidence which was before the decision-making body.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> But as David Hart QC notes, prior to the Supreme Court decision, ‘the underlying issue in the case (which is ripe for consideration in the Supreme Court) is whether the practical protections built into RIPA for the benefit of the Security Services should be regarded as overriding the skepticism which the courts have expressed about any attempt to oust their powers.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> And indeed, the Supreme Court found such practical considerations less important in relation to the rule of law preoccupations that emerged. After all, as Leggatt LJ pointed out, it is striking that no language so far used has been held to be sufficiently clear to oust judicial review,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> and <em>Privacy International</em> did not become a first.</p>

<p>Profound constitutional concerns are embedded in both of those arguments that purport to parallel <em>Anisminic</em> with <em>Privacy International</em>, as the mirroring of the ruling of the first on the latter would lead to the re-evaluation of fundamental notions; when <em>Privacy International</em> reached the Supreme Court, everyone knew that the resulting judgments would constitute a useful barometer of where thinking lies at the highest judicial level on the most delicate of constitutional issues, more than ten years on from <em>Jackson</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> and two years after <em>Miller</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a>.  It is neither easy nor particularly productive to attempt a clear demarcation between the various constitutional concerns, but I would like to focus on statutory interpretation, parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law and the idea of a constitution.</p>

<p>There have been numerous attempts to give a definitive answer to what statutory interpretation entails. Yet, Lady Hale in <em>R (Black) v Secretary of State for Justice</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> seems to succeed in verbalizing a well-established rule, namely that ‘the goal of all statutory interpretation is to discover the intention of the legislation’, and ‘that intention is to be gathered from the words used by Parliament, considered in the light of their context and their purpose’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a></p>

<p>Returning to the case of <em>Privacy International</em>, what does the intent of the legislature seem to be? The words used by Parliament in the ouster clause of <em>Privacy International</em> are different from those of <em>Anisminic</em>. This difference existed for a reason, and it seems logical to infer that Parliament wanted to avoid a similar ruling with that of <em>Anisminic</em>, as it is clearly a more elaborate attempt to exclude judicial review. This observation is not mutually exclusive with Leggatt LJ’s attempt to establish that the language of the ouster clause of <em>Anisminic</em> might be different, but not materially different from that of <em>Privacy International</em>. But from those two views, do we conclude that Parliament did not intend ‘strongly’ enough to oust judicial review, and that is why the wording was different, but not materially different? This interpretation of the statute would lead to the maintenance of the judicial review. Or do we infer that Parliament did intend very strongly to oust judicial review, but the use of ‘jurisdiction’ did not have the same legal effect as if the term  ‘error of law’ might have been used, which would have been an even more express declaration leaving no space for maneuver. This interpretation of the statute would lead to the ousting of judicial review.</p>

<p>The court decided that the first path was  more appropriate. There was no direct address of this dilemma, but their preference became evident when they noted that the exercise is not one of ordinary statutory interpretation, as there is a common law presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the High Court: the plain words of the provision must yield to the principle that it will not protect a decision that is legally invalid.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> It is welcome that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the strictness of the presumption against ouster, in light of the Court of Appeal ‘seeing force’ in the submission that the principle of legality is of ‘variable impact’. This presumption, though, is in effect a disguised prohibition set and enforced by the courts. Therefore, the well-established legislature-centric schema of statutory interpretation emerges as pro tanto: the court will give effect to the legislative intent as long as it is in line with the judiciary’s intent.</p>

<p>In confirming an alternative approach to statutory construction, a challenge to parliamentary sovereignty is born, as the Supreme Court appears to be challenging the legislature’s legally unlimited law-making authority. The Supreme Court divided their decision into two parts, and the constitutional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was implicated in each strand in fundamental ways: first, in the specific context of interpreting Parliament’s legislative intention in enacting a provision which purported to immunise decisions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal from further legal challenge; and second, in relation to whether it can ever be legally possible, in general, for Parliament to enact an ouster clause of this kind.</p>

<p>On the one hand, such speculation about this doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty could be treated as non-determinative of the scope of parliamentary legislative authority, for if Parliament truly is sovereign, this is a matter the courts do not have the authority to decide.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> Instead, the case could be perceived as revealing in so far as it provides a clear insight into the constitutional framework within which many judges increasingly perceive their role and their ability to express ideas of legislative authority.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what if courts are indeed trying to decide the future of parliamentary sovereignty? Recent case development would substantiate this hypothesis. As Lord Steyn notes in <em>Jackson</em>, ‘the judges created this principle [of parliamentary sovereignty]. If that is so, it is not unthinkable that circumstances could arise where the courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> In <em>Privacy International</em>, we see judicial acceptance of the notion that there might be specific limits on Parliament’s power, which come not from EU law, as was the case in <em>Factortame (No 2)</em>, <em>Thoburn</em> or <em>Miller</em> but from the domestic constitutional principle of the rule of law.</p>

<p>Moving on to the rule of law concern, it should be noted that this concept was found in the nucleus of the second question to which the court turned: were there circumstances under which the courts would decline to give effect to a statutory provision which, even when interpreted in light of the ‘fundamental presumption’, did purport to wholly oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the ordinary courts? In <em>Privacy International</em>, it was claimed that the constitutional principle of the rule of law had certain fundamental requirements which no ouster clause, no matter how clearly expressed, could deviate from.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Although their Lordships did not decide on the general lawfulness of ouster clauses, Lord Carnwath sees a strong case for holding that, ‘consistently with the rule of law, binding effect cannot be given to a clause which purports wholly to exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to review a decision of an inferior court or tribunal, whether for excess or abuse of jurisdiction, or error of law’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a></p>

<p>As Leggatt J put it, there is extreme reluctance to ‘attribute to Parliament an intention to achieve a result which would be so clearly inconsistent with the rule of law’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> using language which reminds us of Lord Hope’s words in Jackson, where he claimed that ‘parliamentary sovereignty is no longer, if it ever was, absolute […] The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> The full significance of those statements, which was not part of the binding ratio, may be discovered if the day comes that Parliament passes an ouster clause extreme enough to embrace such an eventuality. Of course we should not forget that there should be a choice: we are not compelled to accept the structures being developed by the courts, which are by no means immutable or inevitable.  Or even if we accept them, it is important for them to have democratic legitimisation by political mechanisms – Acts of Parliament might be made by here-today, gone-tomorrow politicians, instead of the Burkean latent wisdom of the common law, but it is these same politicians that hold the democratic mandate.</p>

<p>But the indisputable effect of having such legal principles developed in isolation from the political arena, over and above political (and especially democratic) principles, is that in some contexts, courts appear to gain ultimate constitutional authority, while in other contexts, parliamentary sovereignty still emerges as uncompromised. Professor Gordon attempted to capture the nature of this ‘catch-all’ constitutionalism by using the term ‘synthetic constitution’, i.e. a framework which is superficially plausible, perhaps in some ways even attractive, but equally one which we are not compelled to accept as absolute or authentic.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> Independently of how ‘artificial’ such an approach is, this ‘synthetic constitution’ seems to be the modern constitutional settlement. As such, maybe we are moving towards a new hypothesis of constitutionalism, which transcends the labels of ‘political’ or ‘legal’ as mutually exclusive and instead, attempts to combine  the two in an optimal way.</p>

<p>The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (“<strong>ECHR</strong>”) into domestic law under the Human Rights Act 1998 (“<strong>HRA</strong>”) is not solely concerned with actions against the institutions of the State, otherwise categorised as “core” public authorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> It also concerns what is come to known as “horizontal effect” - that private litigants may have recourse to Convention rights during their dispute by virtue of requiring the court, based on the cause of action of a claimant, to act compatibly with the Convention.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> The content of the cause of action(s) relied on the Claimant are supported by Convention norms, instead of substituting the common law or statutory cause of action in question. <em>Fearn and others v The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> provides an example of the role of courts in the context of horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act, in this case attempting to fill the gap in the common law action of tort of nuisance. This case note focuses primarily on the approach of Mann J in determining whether a claimed privacy from overlooking can be protected by the tort of nuisance. It argues that a principled and restrained judicial approach is the best in delineating the court’s role of infusing Convention norms into disputes between private parties under s.6(3)(a) HRA 1998.</p>

<h5 id="facts-and-summary-of-judgement">Facts and summary of judgement</h5>

<p>The flats in question were in a development adjacent to the Tate Modern art gallery. Their living areas looked directly onto a viewing gallery which was open to the visitors of the museum. The flats had winter gardens which had wall-to-ceiling windows. The gardens were used by the claimants as part of their living accommodation. Visitors using the gallery had an uninterrupted view of the living areas of the flats.</p>

<p>The claimants alleged that they were the subject of scrutiny by many visitors of the gallery. They submitted that they had a cause of action in nuisance, and argued that they could rely on their right to privacy under Article 8 on the basis that the Defendant is a “hybrid public authority” under s.6(3)(b) HRA 1998.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> In arguing that the Defendants are liable in nuisance, it seeks to bridge the gap between the tort of nuisance and the acts of overlooking in question, relying on the Human Rights Act, and in particular Article 8 of the Convention. The Claimant’s submissions on the role of Article 8 in developing the tort of nuisance are twofold:<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>● Privacy is an aspect of amenity of land. Article 8 reinforces claims to privacy, and courts are now obliged to develop the law so as to give effect to that right of privacy by extending (if necessary) the law of nuisance to protect it. This is mirrored by the extension of the law of confidence to protect private information.</p>

<p>● The nuisance is the operation of the gallery as a viewing gallery, from which there is afforded a view into their flats which is inevitable and which visitors take advantage of, to an extent which affects the use and enjoyment of the flats because it encroaches on and invades their privacy.</p>

<p>Having found that the Defendant is not a “hybrid public authority” under s.6(3)(b),<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> Mann J proceeded to dealt with the core issue of the case and the focus of this case note: the tort of nuisance claim as based on the right to private and family life under Article  8 ECHR.</p>

<h5 id="the-role-of-the-human-rights-act-in-supplying-convention-norms-to-private-actions-the-tort-of-nuisance">The role of the Human Rights Act in supplying Convention norms to private actions: the tort of nuisance</h5>

<h6 id="the-common-law-reaching-out-to-the-human-rights-act-and-convention-norm"><u>The common law reaching out to the Human Rights Act and Convention norm</u></h6>

<p>Mann J began by noting that the tort of nuisance, absent statute, would probably have been capable, as a matter of principle, of protecting privacy rights, at least in a domestic home.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> The Defendant’s concession that deliberate overlooking could give rise to nuisance accompanied by malice suggests that, given the right circumstances, a deliberate act of overlooking could amount to actionable nuisance. Having set out the contours of the common law action, Mann J then moved on to observe that, in the case if there are any doubts as to the ability of nuisance to form a cause of action in the present case, the doubt “has been removed by the Human Rights Act and Article 8,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> which contains a right to respect for an individual’s private and family life and his come. This reinforces the relatively limited and restrained role of Convention norms when the court is adjudicating private disputes: the primary emphasis of protection of privacy horizontally remains in tort law. Convention norms articulating a right to private and family life, while accurately reflecting the position which the individual should be restored in the case of a successful nuisance action, nevertheless should only be consulted in the case of any doubts as to the nature and contours of the common law nuisance action.</p>

<p>Mann J then moved on to note that the notion of “home” is expressly referred to in the present case, stating that “a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to much of what occurs in the home and in relation to the home itself.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> The notion of “home” here as employed, it is submitted, is sufficiently expansive to incorporate issues which are not covered by the common law of nuisance itself. It opens up considerations relevant to an individual’s privacy in a private place (in this place his home), and thus considerations under Article 8, which were originally excluded from consideration due to the court’s conclusion on the s.6(3)(b) issue. At this point, Mann J relied on <em>McKennitt v Ash</em> [2008] to extend the tort of nuisance to cover the alleged tortious actions: that “external prying into a home would contravene the privacy protected by Article 8. It could be done by e.g. particular acts of directed and intentional overlooking, if the circumstances justified it.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> The cause of action resulting from an alleged act of prying does not arise under Article 8 ECHR, but by developing existing causes of action.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> This is the correct and an appropriately restrained judicial approach to the court’s development of the common law in the HRA era. Although the courts cannot a new cause of action based on Convention rights, it is possible for it to fulfil its role of acting compatibly with the Convention by developing existing cause of actions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a></p>

<p>Given the bridge between common law and HRA is bridged by <em>McKennitt</em>, it is worthy to examine it and its relationship with the present case. Focusing on the notion of home, Buxton LJ noted that Article 8 imposes “not merely negative but positive obligations” on the State.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Following so, the effect of s.6 HRA 1998 is that in order to find a breach of confidence, it would be necessary to look into Convention jurisprudence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Buxton LJ also observed that it is possible to draw an analogy between security or stability of the residence with the issue of privacy within the home; it is “intrusive and distressing for Ms McKennitt’s household minutiate to be exposed to curious eyes.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> The basis of a positive obligation to develop a common law cause of action based on the Convention requirements thus lies at the root of section 6. Without such connection, courts cannot simply resort to Convention rights by drawing analogies or comparisons between notions which appear to concern similar issues (e.g. “home”, “privacy” etc.). The court’s duty to act compatibly with the Convention and subsequent inclusion of Convention norms and principles in private law tort claims, otherwise known as “indirect horizontal effect,” is reflected in its modification of common law principles to reflect the relevant fundamental right(s) an individual enjoys under the Convention.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a></p>

<h6 id="support-from-the-human-rights-act-enriching-common-law-jurisprudence"><u>Support from the Human Rights Act: enriching common law jurisprudence</u></h6>

<p>Mann J noted that since the enactment of the HRA 1998, the law of nuisance “ought to be and is capable of protecting privacy rights from overlooking in an appropriate case.” If such development is not made by the courts, there would be “a gap in the protection of privacy in the home where e.g. a landowner used his/her land to spy on a neighbour unreasonably.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Together with his reliance on <em>McKennitt v Ash</em>, it appears that the “bridge” in question that brings norms underlying the Convention and the concerns of the common law tort of nuisance is supported by two issues: (i) the notion of the “home” as expressly stated and referred to by the litigating parties in the present case, and (ii) the values and expectations associated with privacy and the concept of a “home.” Commenting on the court’s approach to the horizontal effect of Convention rights, Phillipson observed that the courts’ approach in finding values applicable to the situation before them is an instance of identifying some broad principles that should be taken into account. This differs sharply from saying that the individual “has” rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> None of the cases concerning the protection of individual privacy under tort law post-HRA 1998, from <em>Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers</em> to <em>Fearn</em>, has accepted full or direct horizontal effect of Convention rights. A private litigant is not allowed to invoke a Convention right directly against another private individual, and then asking courts to adjudicate on the merits of the Convention rights claim directly.</p>

<p>The ultimate concern in question, as the courts’ approach demonstrates, is the substance of the common law on which, in light of the incorporation of Convention rights into domestic law under HRA 1998, the parties will be entitled to protection on. This is generally consistent with domestic courts’ previous approaches to the issue of indirect horizontal effect of Convention rights in, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Campbell</em> and <em>Douglas v Hello! Ltd</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> In <em>Douglas</em>, it was stated that it was “no longer the case” that “Strasbourg provides no definite answer to the question of whether the Convention requires states to provide a privacy remedy against private actors.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> The seminal ECHR case of <em>Von Hannover v Germany</em>, in which the ECtHR recognised the possibility of a positive obligation on the part of the State to protect an individual’s Article 8 right,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> was cited by the Court of Appeal as a direct authority for finding a positive obligation on the part of the State to ensure that a private remedy is available for the claimants in the case of a successful action.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p><em>Tate Modern</em> is an interesting decision illustrating how the HRA shapes the development of domestic law. It shows that the Act, despite having no direct bearing on private actions, can nevertheless enter into the realm of private law via the doctrine of horizontal effect. While the full implications of the case cannot be examined in the limited space of this essay, it is nevertheless clear that the HRA does not only shape our rights as individuals against public authorities,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> but also disputes in private law.</p>
