	     <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p><em>Have you ever wondered how ‘West Side Story’ might have been resolved in the English courts? In such cases of gang violence, the area of complicity governs the typical situation where the accused (the ‘Accessory’) did not commit the crime but assisted or encouraged the principal offender to do so. This note analyses the impact of R v Jogee, arguably the most seminal case in this area of law,by tracing the legal and social aftermath of the decision. It begins by questioning how Jogee was initially lauded for its reversion back to principle, and the extent to which it truly righted a ‘wrong turn’ in the law by navigating the academic literature on the disputed issue of intention in the Jogee judgement. In discussing the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the current law on accomplice liability, this note ultimately still finds the law wanting of necessary clarifications. Moreover, a holistic approach to reform is required, including ensuring the integrity of prosecution charging decisions by removing the inaccurate racialised gang narrative permeating this area of law. This work was inspired by LSE’s Criminal Law syllabus on the topic of Complicity. I declare that it has not been submitted elsewhere.</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction <a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></h3>

<p>Pre-<em>Jogee</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> a defendant’s accessorial liability could be established via two avenues. First, under section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, where one could be charged with ‘ordinary’ accessorial liability by ‘aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring’ the principal’s offence. Second, via Parasitic Accessorial Liability (‘PAL’), an ‘extended’ form of joint enterprise liability (established in <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em>).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> If two parties undertook a joint enterprise to commit a crime whereby the principal committed a further offence, the secondary would be guilty as an accessory to that further crime (incurring liability ‘parasitic’ on the principal’s crime), if s/he foresaw that the principal would act as s/he did. <em>Jogee</em> purportedly abolished this second route, limiting the basis of criminalising secondary participation to basic accessorial liability.</p>

<p><em>Jogee</em> involved joint appeals for murder convictions where victims were killed by the principals’ use of a knife. However, the prosecution procured convictions by arguing that the defendants had engaged in a joint enterprise to commit the act which caused the victim’s death. In Mr Jogee’s case, he and Mr Hirsi became increasingly intoxicated whilst together. Later, they visited Mr Fyfe’s residence where they had heated exchanges with Mr Fyfe. Mr Fyfe was subsequently stabbed to death by Mr Hirsi. Mr Jogee had been outside striking a car with a bottle and shouting encouragement at Mr Hirsi to do something to Mr Fyfe. Both men ran off after the stabbing.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Mr Jogee was convicted on the basis that he <strong>foresaw</strong> the principal might intentionally cause grievous bodily harm or murder if the circumstances arose. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction and effected a change to the mens rea requirement, requiring him to have <strong>known or intended</strong> that Mr Hirsi would have intentionally caused grievous harm if the circumstances arose.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>Thus, <em>Jogee’s</em> abolition of the PAL doctrine reflects a swing of the judicial pendulum from a crime-control model based on public policy reasons, back to a due-process model grounded on principled reasons (pre-existing <em>Powell</em>).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> For our purposes, the most salient traits of the due-process model embody the ‘minimal assumption’ that the defendant is innocent until an impartial adversarial trial process. The crime-control model prioritises repression of any criminal conduct and regards preliminary screening by the police and prosecution as ‘adequate guarantees of reliable factfinding’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>In theory, while <em>Jogee</em> limits the scope of joint enterprise and brings the jurisprudence of joint enterprise back to principled grounds, it does not necessarily eradicate the operation of PAL. In practice, the highly restrictive judicial approach to appeals that has developed since <em>Jogee</em>, and discriminatory prosecutorial framework based upon a racialised gang narrative present additional challenges to the ‘ground-breaking’ status <em>Jogee</em> was lauded for when it was decided five years ago. It is worth mentioning from the outset that joint enterprise is a heavily politicised doctrine, which provided prosecutors with a brutal but effective mode of crackdown on homicide cases. Hence, clarity is needed to prevent undue side effects of the judgement from materialising, and a wider approach to reform is also required to adequately deal with the doctrine’s social impact.</p>

<h3 id="theoretical-analysis">Theoretical Analysis</h3>

<p><em>Jogee</em> abolished the doctrine of PAL, with the central aspect of change involving the fault element required in PAL. It raised the mens rea threshold for the secondary party from foreseeing (established in <em>Chan Wing Siu</em>) to intending to assist or encourage the principal’s actus reus and mens rea in committing the crime (per <em>Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1975)</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<h4 id="past-policy-significance-of-pal"><em>Past policy significance of PAL</em></h4>

<p>Simester’s moral forfeiture theory of liability provides a justification in principle for joint enterprise,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> whereby a group constituted by joint enterprise has set itself against the law and society at large. However, given the doctrine’s expansiveness, it is realistically more likely motivated bypolicy concerns of exercising deterrence and public protection. As Lord Steyn in <em>Powell</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> points out, the accessory principle is ‘needed and cannot be abolished or relaxed’ because of the ‘social problem’ that ‘criminal enterprises’ often ‘escalate into the commission of greater offences’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> This understanding aligns with the psychological ‘risky shift phenomenon’, whereby an individual’s estimation of risk is skewed when acting as part of a group and may act in a more extreme manner.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> The House of Lords in <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> seemed to conceive PAL as essential to prevent an accomplice from evading the consequences of a criminal enterprise, seemingly taking any occasional injustices in its stride as ‘necessary evil’. The stakes are high given that in England and Wales, the accomplice is punished for the same offence as the principal. In effect, it was possible to sentence the accomplice to life imprisonment as long as s/he was <strong>reckless</strong> to the commission of murder, despite not having intended murder to be committed. The disparity of treatment between the principal and accomplice was particularly problematic for homicide, which has a mandatory life imprisonment sentence. This created a legal limbo between convicting the accomplice for the full offence of murder or letting them go scot free although they may not have been fully innocent. Neither options in this binary system proportionately label the accessory’s liability nor provide the flexibility to charge them according to their degree of involvement.</p>

<p>The developing backdrop of policy reasons has not only caused PAL to incriminate disproportionately but also caused confusion for accessory liability generally. <em>Gnango</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> has exemplified the confusion over joint enterprise, where the victim was caught in crossfire between two gunmen on the way home. Finding that two characters with diametrically opposed intents were engaged in a joint enterprise undermined the assumption that parties in a joint enterprise would be acting in concert. This legal fiction imputed foresight where it was non-existent, equating it to intention, thus revealing a blatant policy-driven approach where joint enterprise principles have been twisted and stretched to establish full liability for murder. As Virgo argues, the judgements of Lords Clarke, Brown and Dyson allowed the significance of the relevance of a joint enterprise to overwhelm the need to prove actus reus and mens rea by ‘completely ignoring’ the two fundamental principles.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>This evinces the degree of prevalent confusion that is the ‘characteristic weaknesses’ of a doctrine that was allowed to develop in a ‘pragmatic and unprincipled’ manner.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a></p>

<h4 id="restoration-of-principle"><em>Restoration of Principle</em></h4>

<p>Thus, <em>Jogee</em> arguably brings accessorial liability back to principled grounds, righting a ‘wrong turn’ of ‘questionable policy arguments’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> The PAL doctrine in <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> had shifted the focus of the mens rea requirement onto the accessory’s foresight on what the principal might do, rather than on his intention of how the principal should act, drastically lowering the threshold for convicting defendants involved in a joint criminal venture. The bar is further lowered in cases where it is unclear whether the defendant is the principal or the accessory; as <em>Gianetto</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> shows, the prosecution need only prove that the defendant possessed the requisite mens rea and contributed to the end result to be held fully responsible for the crime.</p>

<p>In <em>Jogee,</em> the Supreme Court clarified that foresight is no more than ‘evidence’ for the requisite intention; while intention may be ‘conditional’, the jury must be sure that a defendant on trial as a secondary had intended the criminal outcome. This upholds several cardinal principles within the criminal law, including the principles of responsibility <a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> that one should only be held responsible for his intended acts, as well as proportionality and fair labelling in sentencing. Pre-<em>Jogee,</em> the judge was obliged to sentence convicted secondary participants to mandatory life imprisonment, although they might have been convicted on mere foresight.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> The situation reeks of injustice with the blatant lack of discretion to mitigate the sentence according to the defendant’s level of involvement. As Wilson and Ormerod argue, if the law wishes to hold a defendant liable for reckless foresight and the ‘danger his own acts excite’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> the appropriate charge is one of manslaughter (the substituted crime Jogee was sentenced for), but not murder. This has been explicitly confirmed in paragraph 96 of <em>Jogee</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> Now, the possibility of a substitute manslaughter conviction allows for the judge to vary the sentence proportionate to individual culpability.</p>

<p>However, the assertion that complicity has been restricted through the elimination of PAL may not be entirely valid given the blurry intention/foresight distinction and the shifted focus on to conditional intent in <em>Jogee</em>.</p>

<h4 id="residual-unclarity--backdoor-for-pal"><em>Residual Unclarity = Backdoor for PAL?</em></h4>

<p>Although the court recognised that foresight was ‘good evidence’ of intention and that the two were ‘not synonymous’, <em>Jogee</em> is crucially silent on what threshold of foresight from the defendant might enable a jury to infer requisite intent. This could lead to juries readily inferring intent from some ‘middling’ degree of foresight,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> effectively neutralising <em>Jogee</em>’s effect on complicity.</p>

<p>Moreover, the courts left open the question as to whether oblique intention in secondary liability was to be treated similarly as in the law of murder, notably without addressing <em>Woollin</em> where a high threshold of foresight (‘virtual certainty’) is considered sufficient intention. <em>Jogee</em>’s ambivalence may allow the jury to infer an accessory’s intent to murder based on foresight alone, including a lower level than virtual certainty. Krebs highlights that ‘as long as <em>Woollin</em> remains good law’, <em>Jogee</em> cannot achieve its aim of restoring parity of culpability between the principal and accessory.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> However ‘virtually certain’ an accessory may be of a principal’s plans, this remains ‘a far cry from the certainty of future <em>causal</em> developments described in <em>Woollin</em>‘<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a>: This presumed application of <em>Woollin</em> in accessorial liability cases is also problematic in <strong>two</strong> senses: First, <em>Woollin</em> is epistemically problematic in the joint enterprise situation where multiple actors are involved. Liability is essentially determined on another free human being acting conditionally. Secondly, even where the accessory has the requisite conditional intent, ‘any number of things might transpire to deter’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> the principal from killing. Given the accessory has no bearing on both of these issues, this reinforces how the accessory’s agency over culpability for their own actions remains lacking due to unclarity as to how other doctrines might apply.</p>

<p><em>Jogee</em> also recognises that the accessory’s conditional intent will be sufficient mens rea. The enlargement of the role of conditional intent may be restrictive for collateral which is less likely to be attributable to complicity parties due to an evidential lack of prior planning. However, Ashworth highlights how the retention of conditional intent allows the jury to infer intention and ‘tacit agreement’ through foresight in effect, if s/he foresaw that the principal might decide to intentionally inflict that level of harm.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> This bears ‘striking resemblance’ to parasitic accessorial liability as Smith has noted.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Perhaps, this gives credence to Stark’s observation that <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> was not a wrong turning of the law as <em>Jogee</em> portrayed, but an honest recognition of what the law is, citing a ‘wider principle’ beyond the standard assisting and encouraging whereby the accessory is criminally liable for the principal’s acts ‘of a type which [s/he] foresees but does not necessarily intend’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> Hence it seems that PAL has not been abolished but rather ‘tamed’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> perhaps operating more covertly as recognised by the Hong Kong case <em>Chan Kam-Shing</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> where the formulation of conditional intent in <em>Anwar</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> (‘if the circumstances arise’) was taken to be suggestive that English law was drifting back to joint criminal enterprise. On this basis, <em>Jogee</em>’s restriction of the complicity’s scope seems ‘less than might have been appreciated’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> as it is formal rather than substantive.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a></p>

<h4 id="is-residual-unclarity-entirely-undesirable"><em>Is Residual Unclarity Entirely Undesirable?</em></h4>

<p>While <em>Jogee</em> signals an intention to return to more principled grounds, more clarity on the requisite threshold of foresight is necessary to ensure legal consistency and certainty, all the more imperative given the heavy charges and high stakes involved. Ashworth has argued against any leeway on the requisite degree of foresight to infer intention, contending that the courts should aim to introduce a tighter definition of intention for such a serious offence and deal with more complicated cases using defences or partial defences.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> However, this argument assumes that <em>Jogee</em> was trying to substantively define intention in the first place. One might question if it is even possible for the Supreme Court to provide a threshold that would provide clear guidance in the multiplicity of joint enterprise cases, without being a mere empty label. It is easier to make a negative statement that foresight was not intention, but harder to provide positive guidance for the threshold of foresight that would amount to intention. Moreover, it is notable that the concept of foresight being taken as evidence for intention was not birthed from <em>Jogee</em>, but appears in virtually every single case. When framing charges, the prosecution works to convince the jury to draw the necessary inference of intention from foresight. As expressed by Lord Bridge in <em>Moloney</em>, ‘[foreseeability] belongs, not to the substantive law, but to the law of evidence’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a></p>

<p>While Ormerod and Laird have rightly criticised the ambiguity of the new mens rea requirement,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> it might be argued ambiguity is not necessarily wholly undesirable. Rather, it may mean flexibility allowing for the law to cater to a range of defendant profiles. Instead of providing a backdoor for the old law to creep in, it might be perceived as a tool allowing the jury to convict where the defendant is highly culpable, similar to the retention of jury ‘moral elbow room’ as in <em>Woollin</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> a term coined by Horder referring to the jury’s discretion on whether the crime fits the defendant’s conduct.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> One’s view of the legal inbuilt flexibility left in <em>Jogee</em>’s wake may to a certain extent turn on one’s trust in the exercise of discretion by the judge and jury. It also allows the accessory a chance to argue that while s/he might have had some level of foresight, it did not amount to intention. Comparatively, the previous approach meant that any foresight made a conviction virtually certain.</p>

<p>Overall, the extent to which complicity has been restricted in practice is questionable. Given the Supreme Court’s vague treatment of the actus reus requirement of joint enterprise as a ‘common unlawful purpose’, the fundamental effectiveness of <em>Jogee</em>’s purported abolition of PAL is debatable. Hence, Virgo’s perspective of the implicit existence of PAL as a ‘backdoor’ is arguably more convincing than Simester’s view that PAL has been successfully abolished by <em>Jogee</em>’s return to principle.</p>

<h3 id="observations-in-practice">Observations in Practice</h3>

<p>Moreover, the theoretical potential for PAL to creep back into the law is an even more realistic practical concern when contextualised in the reality of discriminatory prosecutorial practices, coupled with low prospect of successful appeals.</p>

<h4 id="high-threshold-for-appeals"><em>High threshold for appeals</em></h4>

<p>Ormerod and Laird have postulated that the Supreme Court may have intended for conditional intent to apply only in limited circumstances.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> However, Dyson points out that in practice, a defendant convicted under PAL may still be liable through having conditional intent that the principal will commit the crime.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> This was starkly demonstrated in <em>R v Johnson and Others,</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a>where the Court of Appeal faced a range of appeals contending wrongful convictions under the old law.Yet, it appeared surprisingly easy to establish that accomplices liable for PAL would now be convicted of murder based on conditional intent.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> The court appeared confident that in all cases, the appellants had the ‘necessary conditional intent’ that the weapon be used with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<p>To bring an appeal against a conviction ‘out of time’ (lodged over 28 days post-conviction), an applicant needs ‘exceptional leave’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> and this will only be granted if the applicant can demonstrate having suffered ‘a substantial injustice’ due to the change in the law. The Court of Appeal made clear that they were not interested in investigating whether the change <em>might</em> have made a difference to the verdict, or whether the applicant suffered adverse consequences from conviction, such as stigmatisation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> The court admitted this was ‘a high threshold’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> but it has proven relatively insurmountable. To date, only one case (<em>R v Crilly</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a>) has successfully appealed under <em>Jogee</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> and the Court of Appeal was clear to present a ‘faithful’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> adherence to the restrictive approach in <em>Johnson</em>. The focus is not on jury misdirection but the basis of prosecution itself - in <em>Crilly,</em> the prosecution’s case was evidently ‘to all intents and purposes a case about his foresight’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> as opposed to intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<h4 id="unchanged-framework-of-discriminatory-prosecutorial-practices-and-institutionalised-racism"><em>Unchanged framework of discriminatory prosecutorial practices and institutionalised racism</em></h4>

<p>Yet, even for the rare successful appeal applicants and defendants post-<em>Jogee</em>, there is little relief in practice. Consideration of the law post-<em>Jogee</em> has shown disappointing realisation of the regressive potential of <em>Jogee</em>’s uncertainties.</p>

<p>Socially, PAL critics were less preoccupied with the unprincipled elision of mens rea levels but more concerned with the extensive, disproportionate and discriminatory incrimination. The Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge found that joint enterprise convictions lead to three times as many black men serving life sentences than those in the general prison population.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> Birkbeck’s Prison Reform Trust study found that two-thirds of their sample belonged to a minority ethnic group, and over 40% were black.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> Similar trends can be found in the age of joint enterprise convicts, slanting heavily toward 18-24 year olds with a surprising number of under-18 convictions as well.</p>

<p>Underlying PAL’s propensity for the conviction of young minorities is a narrative rooted in the justification for joint enterprise itself.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> The oft-peddled explanation for the need of such an expansive tool of incrimination is the difficulty of prosecuting gang crimes - the confusion of who did what and who said what creates intensive prosecutorial difficulties to illustrate to the jury the role each defendant played in the overall crime. During the rampant public disorders of the 1980s, the police were given enhanced stop and search powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 (also the year <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> was decided). The reputational expansiveness of joint criminal enterprise led its acronym ‘JCE’ to be referred to as ‘Just Convict Everyone’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Furthermore, ‘suspect populations’ were identified to have greater propensity to engage in organised crime, discriminatorily targeting ethnic minority communities and controversially conflating the ‘criminal gang’ with ‘Black youths’ in media and political discourse.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a></p>

<p>Joint Enterprise is therefore a political tool for simplification of both the prosecution and jury’s task. The Crown Prosecution Service’s own direction on the relevance of ‘gang’ references explains its utility as an evidentiary basis for a chain of inferences.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> Association with a gang can lead to an inference of knowledge of the gang’s predisposition for violence, which can lead to an inference of the requisite mens rea.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> <em>Jogee</em> does not change all this. Although the requisite mens rea is changed from foresight to intention, the jury is free to infer intention from foresight. <em>Jogee</em> merely adds another link in the chain of inference starting from gang association to conviction. It would be ‘misguided’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> to assume that the prosecuting parties would not continue making the same extended inferences from gang associations. With the pressing doctrinal questions that <em>Jogee</em> leaves unresolved, the same issues with joint enterprise may well continue to be systemically perpetuated. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has adduced evidence demonstrating that convictions are being secured in our courts without sufficient evidence to convict, especially in cases where there are <strong>more</strong> defendants when the CPS is ‘more likely to offer no evidence’ for at least some defendants.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> <em>Jogee</em>’s framework does not prohibit this. This is particularly problematic in light of the questionable relationship between joint enterprise and the racialised gang narrative.</p>

<p>The problem is that ‘gang’ narratives seem to be part and parcel of some joint enterprise prosecutions regardless of whether the label fits. The CPS is adamant that ‘gang’ references must be ‘cautious[ly]’ made and only invoked with a proper ‘evidential basis’, but it seems like the bar for what counts as ‘evidence’ can be grossly low.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> The widely reported ‘Moss Side’ murder case provides a clear demonstration of <em>Jogee</em>’s equivocal aspects. Eleven defendants aged 14-20, all ethnic minorities, were convicted on the basis of joint enterprise liability in <em>R v Goodall</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> During the trial, the prosecution explained that when the defendants chased and beat the victim, culminating in one of the defendants delivering a fatal stab, it was a co-ordinated gang attack on a member of a rival gang.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a> In terms of evidence, the Crown claimed the defendants had ‘self-admissions’ of gang memberships.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline62" href="#62">62</a> Yet, the calibre of evidence presented to evince gang affiliations was apparently the fact that some of the defendants did hand signs in their Instagram pictures, which the prosecution argued amounted to admission of gang affiliations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline63" href="#63">63</a> Those for whom such condemnatory evidence was not found, had their association proven on the basis of their friendships with those who had.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline64" href="#64">64</a> The presence of a ‘gang’ provided a prosecutorial framework to construct a hindsight narrative of the facts, presenting a situation that reportedly sporadically developed as organised crime.</p>

<p>The empirical evidence for this is faltering. Hallsworth’s behavioural research shows that on the streets, gang structures are ‘radically informal and non-hierarchical’ and organisational plans are ‘situationally determined and driven’ rather than premeditated.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline65" href="#65">65</a> The ‘gang’ discourse therefore problematically permeates prosecutorial tendencies, since the evidence does not meet Feinberg’s threshold of ‘a very high degree of antecedent group solidarity’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline66" href="#66">66</a> to render this framework morally acceptable. Moreover, the inbuilt biases of the racialised gang narrative further compromise on the integrity of the policing process. Amnesty International’s recent report has highlighted the Gangs Matrix database used by the Metropolitan Police as racially stigmatising and the ‘wrong tool for the wrong problem’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline67" href="#67">67</a></p>

<p>Recognising that gang associations are based on dubious evidential grounds, the statistic that almost 80% of ethnic-minority joint enterprise prisoners were labelled gang members compared to 38.5% of white prisoners is condemnatory and discriminatory.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline68" href="#68">68</a> When the basis of a defendant’s gang association is suspect, it is difficult not to be critical of the fact that joint enterprise post-<em>Jogee</em> still allows the prosecution to draw and the jury to follow a chain of inferences that leads rather conveniently down a slippery slope from ‘possible gang member’ to ‘guilty’. In this respect, the jury’s discretion left in <em>Jogee</em> compounded by prosecutorial discretion in the law enforcement system may not have addressed a problematic status quo of institutional racism at all but perpetuated it.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Theoretically, <em>Jogee</em> on paper is a much-needed reversion back to principle, allowing for fair labelling of criminals by raising the mens rea requirement to reflect their culpability more accurately. However, many potential issues remain unclarified, notably whether it truly does change the law or simply allow the old law to operate beneath indeterminate wording. Coupled with the practical context that access to appeals is heavily restricted and the inbuilt biases in the prosecution procedures, it is submitted that until these elements are rectified, we remain yoked to the underlying vestiges of the crime-control model. The Supreme Court may have held that PAL was a ‘wrong turn’ in the law, yet a real reversion to a due-process model to achieve truly criminally just outcomes in the law of Joint Enterprise would require holistic reform: to internally develop and clarify the substantive law, and externally regulate and eliminate biases from the prosecutorial framework.</p>

<p>The English Law on “medical manslaughter”, manifested through the common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter, may be broadly defined as the defendant’s grossly negligent act  or omission, when acting within the terms of their duty of care, which results in the victim’s death. With the current crisis facing the NHS, prosecution of medical practitioners for medical negligence is growing in prominence as a controversial issue, one of which commentators and medical professionals alike are critical of. In the recent case of <em>R v Bawa-Garba (‘Bawa-Garba’)</em>, these criticisms of the current regime concerning gross medical negligence have reached the breaking point. Following a controversial High Court conviction of an NHS junior doctor of gross negligence manslaughter, the Court of Appeal’s refusal the doctor’s leave to appeal sparked a public debate on both legal and political grounds. This case note will begin by providing an account of the <em>Bawa-Garba</em> case. Furthermore, it will consider the problems with the arbitrary standard of gross negligence in the offence of gross negligence manslaughter, and potential incompatibilities with Article 7 of the Human Rights Act (1998). Following that, the legal issues in establishing causation will be examined in light of complications created by existing systemic issues of the NHS, eliciting concern for the “blame culture”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> in the medical profession. Lastly, the argument that the legal uncertainty in this area warrants the re-assessment of the case and the law will be advanced.</p>

<h5 id="part-i-case-digest">Part I: Case Digest</h5>

<h6 id="key-facts3"><u>Key facts<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></u></h6>

<p>A junior doctor, Dr Bawa-Garba applied for permission to appeal against her jury conviction for gross negligence manslaughter for the death of Jack Adcock, a six-year-old boy with Down’s syndrome. In the Crown Court, the jury found Dr Bawa-Garba guilty by a majority of 10 to 2. She was initially sentenced to 24 months imprisonment and suspended for 24 months. Her application for leave to appeal against the conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in December 2016.</p>

<p>Dr Bawa-Garba was the most senior junior doctor on duty at the time when the victim was admitted to the hospital. Jack Adcock was initially treated for acute gastro-enteritis and dehydration and subsequently pneumonia after an x-ray had been taken. The reality was that upon admission to the hospital, the victim’s pneumonia had caused him to go into septic shock, resulting in heart failure. Efforts to resuscitate him were to no avail.</p>

<p>The prosecution’s case was that Dr Bawa-Garba’s serious neglect “had contributed to or caused the boy’s death”, includingfailing to recognise the significance of the victim’s blood test results and to detect sepsis; failing to ask her consultant to review the victim’s condition, and failing to notify Jack’s mother not to administer enalapril (one of the victim’s long-term medications) to Jack, which would precipitously drop blood pressure. The Crown contended that Dr Bawa-Garba’s repeated mistakes over a protracted period amounted to conduct and fell so far below the standard of care expected of a competent professional that it amounted to gross negligence, warranting a criminal conviction.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<h6 id="issues"><u>Issues</u></h6>

<p>On appeal, the defendant contended that there had been a misdirection of the jury in determining the question of causation. The trial judge (Nicol J) had directed the jury to consider whether the victim had “died significantly sooner”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> due to the defendant’s negligence for the prosecution to prove their case. The defendant averred that the right test would have been for the jury to “be sure that there would have been significant prolongation of Jack’s life”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> had the right treatment been given.</p>

<h5 id="part-ii-case-debate">Part II: Case Debate</h5>

<h6 id="a-the-ambiguities-of-gross-negligence"><u>(a) The ambiguities of gross negligence</u></h6>

<p><em>R v Adomako (‘Adomako’)</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> the leading authority on gross negligence manslaughter, defined a five-step test for the offence. Firstly, there must have been a duty of care; secondly, that duty must have been breached; thirdly, the defendant’s breach must have caused the victim’s death; fourthly, there must have been an obvious risk of death, and fifthly, the defendant’s conduct must have been grossly negligent enough to warrant a criminal conviction. The case of <em>Bawa-Garba</em> subjects the third and fifth limbs of the test to scrutiny.</p>

<p>To begin with, <em>Bawa-Garba</em> highlights the lack of clarity in the law with regards to the threshold requirement for the establishment of gross negligence. Since merely causing or allowing death to occur through negligence will not incur a charge of manslaughter, criminal liability for the offence requires an extreme deviation from a reasonable standard of care. Academics such as Kazarian, Griffifths and Brazier have identified the main issue with English Law on gross negligence manslaughter as the “elusive concept of grossness”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> Such elusiveness can be seen in the differing legal tests that have been developed following <em>Adomako</em>. The threshold for establishing gross negligence was prescribed in <em>Adomako</em> as a “breach of duty (that was) so bad, so obviously wrong, that, having regard to the risk of death involved in it, it can properly be condemned as criminal”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> The tone of certitude masks the reality of an ill-defined threshold for gross negligence that fails to adequately distinguish between flagrant negligence and fleeting error.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a></p>

<p>On principle, the Adomako test has often been criticised to be circular,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> with the level of negligence required to hold the defendant culpable being defined as sufficiently negligent to deserve a criminal conviction for manslaughter.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Furthermore, the inability of the <em>Adomako</em> test to meet the test of certainty required by Article 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 was challenged in <em>R v</em> <em>Misra (‘Misra’).</em> Article 7 stipulates that one should not be held guilty for an action that was not a criminal offence when it was committed,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> meaning that clarity on the law is required for doctors to know if their actions are grossly negligent and liable to criminalisation. However, this was quashed in <em>Misra</em> by Lord Justice Judge’s assertion that the question was “not whether the defendant’s negligence was gross, and whether, additionally, it was a crime, but whether his behaviour was grossly negligent and consequently criminal”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> This clarification, unsatisfactory at best, has been characterised by Horder as a “distinction without difference”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> exposing just how manifestly undefined the threshold for “gross” conduct remains today. Given that the medical profession is already fraught with unpredictability and precariousness, such added uncertainty evokes great unease with the current state of law.</p>

<p>In practice, subsequent case law has departed slightly from this definition. More significantly, differing court interpretations have created a degree of legal uncertainty across different cases, demonstrating the elusive aspect of Kazarian’s observation. While the requirement for negligent conduct to be “gross” was “truly exceptionally bad” in <em>Bawa-Garba</em>, it was defined as “reprehensible conduct” in <em>Misra</em>. The use of judicial epithets for gross negligence reflects what Quick terms the “definitional difficulty” of gross negligence manslaughter in the medical context, with no standardised and objective method of categorising episodes as “gross” or “not gross”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Empirical evidence has shown the lack of a clear distinction to create an ambivalent definition, generating “inconsistencies in the verdicts”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> For Dr Bawa-Garba, the repercussions of this meant that her impeccable track record was instantly invalidated by a momentary blunder made after a twelve-hour understaffed shift. Moreover, the fact that there is no statutory footing for gross negligence manslaughter means that the parameters of the crime are defined through case law developments only, despite the severity of the crime. This is further complicated by the fact that <em>Adomako</em> leaves the jury with a wide discretion to decide whether the accused should be convicted.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> As Lord Mackay’s statement essentially asserts that the jury is deliberating a question of law when deciding whether to convict a defendant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Such discretion produces difficulty in predicting jury decisions by creating a margin to make moral decisions. Despite generating a criminal label upon conviction, gross negligence manslaughter remains an issue in flux.</p>

<h6 id="b-systemic-v-individual-failures"><u>(b) Systemic v Individual failures</u></h6>

<p>However, the legal uncertainty created by the ambiguous threshold for establishing grossly negligent conduct is but a preface to the wider debate concerning individual failure in relation to systemic failures within the NHS.</p>

<p>The defendant’s innocence found rapport in the medical profession’s strong dissent against the court’s judgement. Many felt the charge for gross negligence manslaughter was unjustified in light of the wider systemic failings of the NHS, contending that Dr Bawa-Garba had been scapegoated for the system’s shortcomings, such as chronic understaffing, a faulty IT system, and poor rotational shift planning.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> Dr Bawa-Garba’s personal mistakes were to an extent induced by her pressured situation, and, therefore, should not be separated in assessing her overall culpability.</p>

<p>Moreover, failure to factor system problems into the trial process has led to a narrowed scope of understanding causation. By failing to couch individual failures in wider systemic issues, the law on causation has fostered a “blame culture”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> Such a public reaction can be reasonably construed as reflective of how the law of causation falls short of accounting for the complexities of healthcare. The courtroom dissection of hospital tragedies can and may unfairly attribute the blame to the defendant, failing to consider the unpredictable reality of medical practice particularly within the context of NHS burgeoning problem of overstretched resources.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>As Anthony Harvey contends, individual acts of negligence are often identifiable as the product of some larger collective process.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> If it is accepted that criminal responsibility should not start and end with the doctor on trial, then perhaps a widening of the individualistic paradigm currently adopted by the judiciary should follow.</p>

<h6 id="c-causation-and-culpability"><u>(c) Causation and culpability</u></h6>

<p>To what extent, if any, should context be factored into the legal issue of establishing causation remains contentious and unclear. In <em>Bawa-Garba</em>, it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove causation by showing that death “occurred significantly sooner”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> when the necessary treatment was not administered, despite it being unclear if the right treatment would have saved the victim’s life. The fact that the victim died significantly sooner due to the defendant’s negligence was held to be an “inescapable corollary”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> of certainty that “competent treatment would have saved or significantly prolonged life”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> effectively quashing the defendant’s leave to appeal.</p>

<p>There has been difficulty in the law in definitively apportioning the extent to which causation is a question of law rather than a question of fact. Theorists such as Brudner<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> consider the fairness of imputing the consequence on the defendant, whereas others such as Moore<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> would argue that causation should be decided independently of culpability. Such a polarised opinion on whether causation is ultimately a question of fact or law has compromised on the coherence of the law’s approach to causation. Given the complex factual matrix of <em>Bawa-Garba</em> and the nuances typical of the medical environment, it lends credence to Herring’s argument that it is simply impossible for any guiding rules on causation to be established.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Rather, the judge simply considers the common-sense answer to the question of causation and declares that to be the legal position.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a></p>

<p>Another key issue with this approach is that it focusses on causal attribution of individual blame, arguably failing to adequately consider the contextual concerns of the case. At the time of the tragedy, Dr Bawa-Garba’s circumstances were clearly fraught with system pressures, including a twelve-hour double-shift during which she was the only junior doctor present, and an IT failure that delayed the victim’s blood test results for six hours.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> These circumstantial factors, having caused Dr Bawa-Garba’s mistakes, were not sufficiently considered. Given that the offence of gross negligence manslaughter seeks to assess individual culpability, such systemic failings were only considered to be “of peripheral relevance”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> to the trial, and only taken as mitigating factors during the sentencing stage.</p>

<p>Donaldson postulates that “avoidable harm is at its most contentious when the focus is on accountability”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> By demanding individual accountability, the judicial approach taken to causation seeks to apportion blame to the prosecuted individual in a vulnerable position. The scope for determining causation is narrowed down to the actions of the individual being judged in the courtroom, rather than a holistic consideration of systemic failures. Unfortunately, this seemed to be the case in <em>Bawa-Garba</em>. In response to the case, the Minister of Health ordered an official review of medical manslaughter prosecutions attempting to ensure that “systemic issues and human factors” are taken into account, suggesting that the frame for identifying causation has to be reworked.</p>

<h5 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h5>

<p>In conclusion, this case highlights the incompatibility of criminal justice system with the complex nature of healthcare, illustrating the limits of criminal law in administering justice in the field of medical error. <em>Bawa-Garba</em> evidences that the problem with the law on gross negligence manslaughter lies in its inherent state of unclarity in the areas of causation establishment and the threshold for grossly negligent treatment. Inaccuracies remain both in principle and in practice given the systemic failings of the NHS. As such, this case should have been successfully appealed, and the conviction for manslaughter quashed. The defendant was a victim in her own right, having been ensnared by the ambiguity in the present law on gross negligence manslaughter. Reforms are much needed to rectify the implications of such uncertainty on personal accountability. In determining the issue of gross negligence and causation, failure to consider the realities of practice and systemic failings has created a highly unfair situation, where the weight of one systemic disaster has fallen onto the shoulders of a single doctor as a personal catastrophe.</p>

	     <p><strong>R v. Evans: An Uneasy Precedent?</strong></p>

<p>In this piece, I discuss the recent case of <em>R v Evans</em>, in which the Court of Appeal allowed the defence to adduce evidence regarding the complainants’ sexual history with third parties in the context of a rape trial. I will assess the academic debate surrounding the controversy the case brought through the expansion of s 41(3)(c) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 to allow such evidence to be adduced. As such expansion has been criticised on the basis that it has created a tension between the complainant’s right to privacy and the defendant’s right to a fair trial, I will outline the criticism of <em>Evans</em> by various academics, addressing whether these criticisms are sound, and put forward my ideas regarding how the problems of <em>Evans</em> can be resolved (i.e. through a cultural change, as opposed to legislative change). This work was initially inspired by LSE’s Law of Evidence class content. I declare that this work has not been submitted elsewhere.</p>

<p>In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving victims of sexual offences speaking out. It appears therefore timely to review the current law of evidence in this specific context. In particular, the current law concerning sexual history evidence (SHE) has been criticised on the basis that the ruling in <em>R v Evans</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> extends the law too far such that it imbalances the trial by working to the detriment of the complainant, particularly her right to privacy. Indeed, there has been a sense that <em>Evans</em> has led to a regression in the law. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was implemented to protect complainants and prevent against the so-called ‘double myth’, however, with <em>Evans</em> as precedent, their protections have been put at risk and the ‘double myth’ has returned.</p>

<p>Firstly, this article will outline the law on SHE and will give a brief overview of the <em>Evans</em> case. Then, it will assess whether the law needs reform, drawing on academic debate. Finally, this article will discuss the current proposals for reform and will put forth its own reform idea. In summary, this article strongly argues that the current SHE regime works to the detriment of the complainant in some instances, however, this is due to a misapplication of the law rather than a problem with the law itself. To reform the law and make it more restrictive would work to the detriment of the defendant and his right to a fair trial. Thus, instead of reforming the law, a cultural change is needed regarding the public perception of sexual offences and gender roles. This cultural change would alleviate issues such as deterring victims and victim-blaming. More importantly, this reform option would not compromise either the right of the defendant or the complainant.</p>

<h5 id="understanding-the-current-law">Understanding the current law</h5>

<p>The admissibility of SHE is governed by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. According to s 41, there is a general ban on the admission of SHE so that the defence is not allowed to ask questions in cross-examination or adduce evidence of the complainant’s sexual behaviour. Sexual behaviour is defined under s 42(1)(c) as meaning previous sexual encounters with the defendant or any other person. In some instances, however, the court may grant leave to the defence to adduce SHE contained in s 41(3)(a), (b) and (c). Per s 41(3)(a), a court may grant leave if SHE is relevant to an issue other than the issue of consent. Other issues include: whether the defendant had a reasonable belief in consent,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> whether the offence was fabricated, or whether there is a false identity issue. Meanwhile, s 41(3)(b) allows the defence to adduce evidence where there is evidence of sexual behaviour ‘at or about the same time’ as the offence. In the case of <em>R v A</em>, ‘at or about the same time’ was defined in <em>dicta</em> as being constrained to twenty-four hours.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> Finally, s 41(3)(c) provides that evidence of sexual behaviour may be adduced where it is ‘so similar’ to any sexual behaviour the complainant engaged in with the defendant or which took place at the same place/time. This was seen in <em>R v T</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> where it was held that the fact that the complainant had engaged in sexual behaviour previously with the defendant at the same place made it more likely she consented.</p>

<p>However, these exceptions found within s 41(3) are subject to further restrictions. First, the evidence must relate to ‘specific instances’ of sexual behaviour<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a>; second, a refusal of leave might have the result of rendering an unsafe verdict <a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a>; finally, the purpose must not be to impugn the credibility of the complainant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>Case law has further expanded the instances where SHE may be adduced by the defence and this has been evidenced by both <em>R v A</em> and <em>Evans</em>. In <em>R v A</em>, the House of Lords allowed defence counsel to adduce evidence of SHE between the complainant and defendant to provide the jury with context to make a fully informed decision. Indeed, there were concerns that the current regime prevented the jury from knowing the context and potentially prevented the defendant from putting a defence forward. Thus, the court found that the legislation was too restrictive in this respect. The court went as far as to say that preventing the jury from knowing the context could amount to a violation of the defendant’s right to a fair trial per Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, the court introduced an implied provision based on fairness through their s 3 power of the Human Rights Act (HRA). This provision established that if it is necessary to adduce SHE for fairness then it is admissible.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in <em>Evans</em>, the court expanded the s 41(3)(c) provision by allowing SHE regarding conduct between the complainant and third parties to be adduced. The context was that the defendant (Evans) was initially found guilty of rape in 2012. The defendant appealed his conviction; new evidence was brought to light concerning two other men. The two men  claimed they had sex with the complainant around the same time as the alleged rape and described their encounters as similar to Evans’ account. Indeed, the Court of Appeal identified the following ‘similar’ elements: the complainant ‘had been drinking’; she ‘instigated certain sexual activity’; she ‘directed her sexual partner into certain positions’ and ‘used specific words of encouragement.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> This was enough to satisfy s 41(3)(c) and so, the defendant was acquitted. However, some commentators have been particularly critical of these developments, arguing that reform is necessary because (a) the current law tilts the balance too heavily in favour of the defendant at the expense of the complainant’s right to privacy<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a>; and (b) it creates a significant risk that the jury takes irrelevant evidence into account.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a></p>

<h5 id="considering-the-arguments-for-reform">Considering the arguments for reform</h5>

<p>Certain commentators have viewed <em>Evans</em> and <em>R v A</em> as setting an uneasy precedent which effectively deters victims from reporting sexual offences through the fear of cross-examination of their sex life. Indeed, by establishing that sexual behaviour does not have to be ‘bizarre’ or ‘unusual’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> effectively sets a very low bar on the admission of SHE. However, others have read the ruling in a more sympathetic light. Dent and Paul, for instance, disagree with this claim and argue that it is not the law that deters victims from reporting but the media coverage of sexual offences.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> In contrast, McGlynn uses empirical data, like surveys and police records, to highlight that the court process, including admission of SHE, does impact on complainants’ decision-making.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> McGlynn shows that the admissibility of SHE results in many complainants withdrawing their claims for fear of the potential invasion of their privacy and that their sex life may be the subject of the trial, and concludes that there is a need for reform. Indeed, by sacrificing the complainant’s private life, this interpretation of the provision arguably goes against Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, a ‘legal system that allows extensive examination might one day be contrary to Article 8.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a></p>

<p>Some have also argued that the ruling of <em>Evans</em> evidences a need for reform because the current law encourages victim-blaming.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Arguably, with <em>Evans</em> we see a shift in attention from ‘probative credibility’ to ‘moral credibility’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Moral credibility ‘refers to the general ability of a witness to tell the truth.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Moral credibility is problematic since it can ‘distract jurors attention from the consideration of rape, directing them towards that of sex’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> and thus lack of consent versus consent. This ‘Madonna-whore complex’ (in which chastity is moral, and so, trustworthy, whereas unchastity is immoral, and so, untrustworthy) finds that ‘women of ill-repute are not to be trusted in their testimony.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> Indeed, Smart observes in a rape trial the complainant’s previous sexual relations are ‘reconstructed into a standard form of sexual fantasy… in which she becomes the slut who turns men on and indicates her availability through every fibre of her clothing and demeanour’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a>  and so, during the trial, the body ‘becomes literally saturated with sex.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a>  In this respect, SHE ‘risks introducing irrelevant or prejudicial material which may distort rather than promote the fact-finding role of the trial’. <a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> Instead, it makes the complainant’s sex life, and behaviours more generally, the subject of the trial. Thus, jurors focus on the ‘respectability’ of women complainants, with evidence of previous sexual activity or any other activity that attracts moral judgement reducing their ‘respectability’ which, in turn, reduces the assessment of credibility. This essentially shifts legal and moral blame from the defendant to the complainant. </p>

<p>When considering this point in the context of <em>Evans</em>, the argument concerning moral credibility is particularly persuasive. <em>Evans</em> has been viewed by some as particularly invasive of the complainant’s private life. Baird, in particular, fears that with <em>Evans</em> as a precedent, rape trials could become inquisitions into the complainant’s sex life,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a>  and within the adversarial trial, these inquisitions can be quite terrifying seeing as the prime tactic is to discredit complainants. Complainants have, therefore, described the task of appearing in court as ‘worse than the rape itself.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> <em>Evans</em>, in this respect, effectively perpetuates the ‘double myth’ that because a woman consented on one occasion, she is more likely to consent on another. Likewise, it perpetuates the ‘double myth’ in the minds of the jury that because of the complainants’ previous sexual activity, she is morally questionable and so, untruthful. Thus, this type of evidence being adduced may, as Redmayne suggests, result in a prejudicial effect whereby the jury might ‘take a dim view of the complainant.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a>  The law on the admissibility of SHE, therefore, needs to be reformed because concerns surrounding the moral credibility of the complainant could result in prejudicial effect against her, which could sway the jury in the defendant’s favour. However, Dent and Paul are critical of the arguments stating that <em>Evans</em> represents a return to the ‘double myth.’  Instead, they highlight that s 41 is a high bar for SHE to be admitted, and that <em>Evans</em> was a very particular case with a particular set of facts, so it is more the exception than the rule.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Yet, this is not the case. As shown by <em>Evans</em> the threshold is not that high.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> Indeed, in <em>Evans</em> evidence was admitted because in previous sexual encounters, the complainant had been drinking and had used a particular phrase/position. Such commonplace behaviour was considered unusual and this significantly lowers the bar for ‘similarity’. Thus, reform is necessary to overcome issues surrounding moral credibility and prejudicial effect.</p>

<p>Finally, commentators such as Redmayne have argued that <em>Evans</em> is problematic in that it assigns probative value to SHE, when such evidence has little probative value.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Indeed, just because someone consents to someone on one occasion, that does not make it more or less likely that they will consent to that person (or another person) on another occasion.  There ‘is no probative connection between consenting to one person and consent to a different person.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> Criticisms that <em>Evans</em> has brought to light regarding the perpetuation of the so-called ‘double myth’ has led to increased calls for reform.</p>

<h5 id="proposals-for-reform">Proposals for reform</h5>

<p>There have been some proposals for reform. For instance, the Harman reform proposed a complete abolition on s 41 exceptions, such that that complainants should never be cross-examined regarding their sex life.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a>  Commentators such as McGlynn have argued in favour of the Harman reform on the basis that SHE should always be excluded since it is irrelevant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a>  They ask: what is the relevance between consenting to one person on one occasion and consenting to another person on another?</p>

<p>Yet this article does not favour such a drastic option. Instead, to view SHE as never relevant is equivalent to viewing the offence of rape from the perspective of the complainant only. This is problematic because the law is already too restrictive. It is, as Birch claims, ‘draconian’ and amounts to ‘legislative overkill’ which goes too far against the rights of the defendant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a>  Hoyano’s study also revealed that many within the law profession viewed the law as already too restrictive.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> The Canadian court considered an option similar to the Harman reform and concluded that a complete prohibition is inconsistent with the fundamental rights of the defendant to a fair trial.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Thus, to reform the law in this way would imbalance the law such that the complainant receives too much protection at the expense of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. This can result in ‘miscarriages of justice’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> because to abolish the s 41 exceptions would mean that the jury has no context upon which to base its decision. This could ultimately lead to unsafe convictions, and perhaps more worryingly, it could lead to false convictions. False convictions should be avoided at all costs since they can have ‘deleterious consequences’ which can result in ‘social, psychological and economic damage.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a></p>

<p>Instead, this article favours the view that there is no problem with the existing law itself. It has simply been misapplied. Indeed, commentators such as Dent and Paul have attempted to reconcile <em>Evans</em> on the basis that it is a simple application of the law. Dent and Paul claim that due to the similarity between the sexual behaviour of the complainant with the defendant and the complainant with third parties, the case was somewhat analogous to <em>R v T</em>. However, such an argument is unpersuasive because <em>Evans</em> and <em>R v T</em> were not analogous. The case of <em>T</em> concerned SHE between the complainant and the defendant, not the complainant and third parties (like in <em>Evans</em>). Stark’s claims are more persuasive in that the court has ‘misdirected’ its attention to s 41(3)(c) when it should have invoked s 41(2)(b).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> Thus, the law itself does not need to be reformed, but rather attention should be refocused to s 41(2)(b) as opposed to s 41(3)(c). By focusing on s 41(2)(b) as opposed to s 41(3)(c) would mean the complainant won’t have their private life scrutinised as harshly, and so their right to privacy will be upheld.</p>

<p>Rather than a change to the existing law, a better option is a cultural change in people’s attitudes. This change would more easily accommodate the current law without compromising either the right of the defendant to a fair trial or the right of the complainant to privacy. Changing the law is unlikely to have a practical impact especially where those applying these rules of evidence have entrenched views on women and how they behave. When SHE is admitted, even where it is relevant, juries will place considerable weight upon it and effectively creates a ‘smokescreen of immorality around the complainer.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> Rape complainants are therefore judged on the basis that women should be adhering to certain moral standards. Failing these standards means there is a high price to pay in that it is unlikely that the jury will trust their testimony. Public and jury education is necessary for this improvement to take place. This would ensure that unfair acquittals based on stereotypes wouldn’t take place. Where there is a cultural change to people’s attitude on rape, issues such as deterrence and victim-blaming will rarely arise. Whilst  such an option may not seem attainable, with the growing awareness concerning sexual crimes, especially in light of #MeToo, we are arguably seeing this cultural change take place, albeit slowly. In the meantime, the law should follow Stark’s recommendations that greater attention should be redirected towards s 41(2)(b) rather than the similarity gateway. However, for the law to work effectively in the long term, a change in cultural beliefs about women is necessary such that cases like <em>Evans</em> never occur again.</p>

<p>To conclude, <em>Evans</em> is certainly a problematic case in that it has expanded the scope of s 41(3)(c) such that SHE is much easier to adduce due to the low bar (not having to be ‘unusual or ‘bizarre’). Yet to reform the law in the complainant’s favour would make the law too restrictive and would come at the expense of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Although there are certainly persuasive reasons pointing to the need for reform, reform to the law is not necessary. Cultural change combined with a refocusing of the court’s attention to s 41(2)(b) could overcome issues such as victim-blaming and deterrence, without compromising either the defendant’s right to a fair trial or the complainant’s right to privacy.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>In general, the privilege against self-incrimination (“<strong>PSI</strong>”) protects a defendant from being compelled to provide (potentially) incriminating statement or information. PSI may be asserted by a defendant in a civil proceeding in opposition to a disclosure order. Like the double-edged sword of Themis, PSI cuts both ways. Upholding a defendant’s assertion of PSI may damage the interest of a claimant. Abrogating PSI may benefit the claimant at the cost of a defendant’s right to trial.  This article argues that the respective approaches of courts in Australia and England &amp; Wales are both unsatisfactory. The main aim of this article is to persuade readers that this area of common law must be replaced by a statutory abrogation of PSI and corresponding prohibition against the use of information obtained in such disclosure order against the defendant in a subsequent criminal prosecution.  </p>

<h5 id="the-psi">The PSI</h5>

<p>The exact origin of this common law right in the United Kingdom is outside of my repertoire. Briefly, it may date back to the abolition of the Court of Star Chamber, which was notorious for extracting admissions of guilt using torture.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> It more likely evolved from the common law’s repackaging of the Canon law doctrine of <em>nemo tenetur seipsum accusare</em> (no one is bound to incriminate themselves).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a></p>

<p>The United States of America enshrined this common law right under the 5^th^ Amendment of its constitution. Justice Goldberg in the <strong>Murphy v Waterfront Commission</strong><a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> case provides a powerful rationale for the PSI rule based on the principles of liberty and fair trial:</p>

<p>“The privilege against self-incrimination ‘registers an important advance in the development of our liberty – one of the great landmarks in man’s struggle to make himself civilized…It reflects many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: our unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt…“<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<p>A defendant in a civil trial is also entitled to the protection of PSI. Indeed, it would be quite inconsistent if the law protects defendants in criminal proceedings but not in civil proceedings, for what is said in a civil court (under oath/ affirmation) may be equally prejudicial and incriminating. For instance, it is not uncommon for courts to grant an ancillary disclosure order in aid of a <em>Mareva</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> injunction.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> The rationale is simple: the effectiveness of the asset-freezing order would be in serious doubt if the claimant has no idea where the defendant’s assets are located, such that it is very hard to monitor whether the order is complied with. The defendant is bound to disclose the information identified in the order against the threat of contempt. Here, if PSI does not apply in civil trial, the defendant is forced to either incriminate himself or perjure. The effect would be that PSI is infringed categorically in civil proceedings: an unthinkable result.</p>

<h5 id="criticism-of-psi-in-civil-trials">Criticism of PSI in Civil Trials</h5>

<p>Despite the real threat to a defendant’s right to fair trial, PSI in civil trials is subjected to formidable judicial criticism. As noted by Lord Neuberger MR in <strong>Gray</strong>, Lord Templeman once described PSI as “an archaic and unjustifiable survival from the past” and questioned whether PSI should be retained in civil proceedings at all.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> The reason given for such a strongly worded criticism is that PSI in civil trials does nothing to protect a defendant from being ill-treated by police or prevent confession wrongly extracted from being admitted in a criminal court, as structural reforms of the way police treats and interviews suspects are needed to ensure fair treatment of criminal defendants.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> For instance, the prosecution may adduce evidence of confessions improperly obtained. If admitted, such confession would not be subjected to protection by PSI. However, Lord Templeman’s objection cannot be put too highly. Protecting a defendant from ill treatment of police is one of the many concerns of a criminal justice system. A defendant may be compelled by the <em>courts</em> on application by the claimant to disclose incriminating/ potentially incriminating information about themselves. This has nothing to do with the police treatment of suspects.</p>

<p>The author nonetheless agrees with Lord Templeman to the extent that PSI in civil trials should be treated with suspicion. Besides the reasons given by Lord Templeman, it is submitted that there are at least two other reasons for not categorically upholding PSI in civil proceedings. Firstly, there is a fundamental difference between the subject matter of a civil and criminal trial. The prosecution, if successful, will result in criminal penalties and related social/ political costs to the defendant. For instance, the defendant may be imprisoned and/ or have their future job prospect and social standing affected. In contrast, the claimant is attempting to obtain civil remedies, largely in the form of monetary awards. Thus, a civil defendant who is forced by court to make disclosures is facing less serious consequences in comparison to a criminal defendant who is forced to answer incriminating questions.</p>

<p>Of course, the first reason does not lose sight of the possibility that what’s said or disclosed in a civil case could be used in a criminal case (as noted above). Thus, the second reason looks at the role of alternative protection in criminal and civil trials. In a criminal trial, it makes no sense to talk about alternative protection given in substitution to PSI. The purpose of a criminal trial is to determine whether the defendant committed the crime(s) charged. What is said or adduced in evidence goes to that purpose. It would make a laughing stock out of courts to force the defendant to make incriminating statements while telling the jury (or the judge reminding her/himself) to disregard such statement. However, in a civil trial, alternative protection could potentially work to achieve a balance between protecting the defendant and upholding the interest of the claimant (discussed in more detail below).  </p>

<p>However, the author disagrees with Lord Templeman in that PSI should not be banished altogether from civil courts. Indeed, even Lord Neuberger MR qualified his criticism of the PSI by saying that it can be abolished if adequate alternative protection along the lines of section 72(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (discussed below) could be offered.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Lord Neuberger MR’s cautious approach is laudable for three reasons. Firstly, the risk of prejudice to the claimant is comparatively less serious than that to the defendant. A claimant may receive a less effective form of civil remedy on the one hand. On the other hand, the risk to a defendant’s liberty and right to fair trial is arguably graver. Secondly, in interlocutory proceedings, once disclosure is made, information cannot be ‘un-disclosed’ if it turns out to be wrongly granted after substantive hearing. The damage to the defendant’s right to fair trial is permanent. Thirdly, the grant of interlocutory injunction is not subjected to a high bar (see the <strong>American Cyanamid</strong><a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> principle). This means that defendants may be compelled to incriminate themselves without the claimant fully proving its case.</p>

<p>If the right to assert PSI in civil proceedings should be subjected to limitations to strike a balance between protecting the defendant and ensuring a claimant gets the just remedies, two further issues arise: (1) What is sufficient alternative protection? And (2) Is statutory reform the way forward?</p>

<h5 id="abrogating-psi-and-the-adequacy-of-protection-question">Abrogating PSI and the adequacy of protection question</h5>

<p>The English &amp; Welsh line of authorities suggest that courts may abrogate PSI if it is satisfied that adequate protection could be substituted. However, this has not always been the case. In <strong>Bishopgate Investmnet Management Ltd</strong>, Dillon LJ stated very strongly that “any decision” to limit or curtail PSI is “essentially a political decision…[which is] a matter for Parliament”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a>. However, subsequent cases instead ask whether sufficient alternative protection could be given to a defendant. See for instance in <strong>AT&amp;T Istel Ltd</strong>, the court was satisfied the defendant could be adequately protected, hence a disclosure order was made. In that case, the CPS submitted a letter acknowledge that it would not be using any information disclosed pursuant to a disclosure order. The judge thus saw fit to issue an order forbidding the use of disclosed information in any subsequent criminal prosecution. While this raises an interesting constitutional question as to the limits of judicial power to modify long standing common law right, it is better dealt with in more depth and focus in a separate piece.</p>

<p>The current English &amp; Welsh approach begs the question however, what is sufficient protection. One may think it could take the form of a claimant’s undertaking to the court that it or any of its associates shall not disclose the information to the police or prosecuting authority. It may seem that such an undertaking is sufficient. Afterall, if a claimant discloses such information, (s)he may be liable for contempt.</p>

<p>However, such undertaking misses the point of PSI. The aim of PSI is to protect a defendant against the risk of prosecution and to prevent compelled statements to be relied on in a criminal trial. The undertaking merely prevents a claimant from adducing the disclosed information to the law enforcement authorities, it does not prevent any such evidence to be relied on in a court by a prosecutor. While the question arise as to the possibility that the prosecution could obtain such evidence, the existence of a possibility cannot be ignored and that the mere <em>fact</em> of disclosure may “set in train a process which may lead to incrimination or may lead to the discovery of real evidence of an incriminating character.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a></p>

<p>Indeed, a line of English authority suggest quite correctly that <em>on top of</em> an undertaking by the claimant, there must also be an undertaking from the prosecution. In <strong>Rank Film</strong>, Lord Wilberforce stated in the context of an <em>Anton Piller</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> order that the protection offered by an undertaking from the plaintiff is only partial, since it does not bind the prosecution.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Thus,  the Court of Appeal in <strong>United Norwest Co-Operatives Ltd</strong><a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> allowed an appeal against a disclosure order on the ground that the defendant’s right to assert PSI was infringed, as the Crown Prosecution Service (“<strong>CPS</strong>”) was not notified of the proceeding and no undertaking was offered. The reason why a CPS undertaking is required is that the CPS cannot be bound by a court order against its will in making its prosecutorial decisions. However, the CPS may, as it did in <strong>AT&amp;T Istel LTd</strong>, undertake not to use material disclosed pursuant to a disclosure order against the defendant in a criminal proceeding.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> However, without such undertaking, the court would not be able to provide an adequate substituted protection.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a></p>

<p>The Australian approach affords comparatively stronger protection to the defendant. In <strong>Reid v Howard</strong><a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a>, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales followed the House of Lords’ decision in <strong>AT&amp;T Istel Ltd</strong><a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> by Handley JA. However, the Court of Appeal decision was reversed by the High Court of Australia. In the majority judgment, the PSI “is not simply a rule of evidence, but a basic and substantive common law right” and can only be overridden by legislation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> The High Court’s decision in <strong>Reid v Howard</strong> case is followed in subsequent cases. In <strong>Vasil</strong>, Fitzgerald JA unequivocally stated that an order of disclosure will be set aside if it infringes PSI without statutory warrant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> Clearly then, the Australian authorities are in direct conflict with the English position. It will be argued below that both the Australian approach and English approach are problematic.</p>

<h5 id="pragmatism">Pragmatism</h5>

<p>It is submitted that the Australian courts’ refusal to abrogate or limit PSI even where adequate substitute protection is available is problematic. There is a paradox here: if the source of PSI is common law, the courts should be able to qualify or even abolish it. Unfortunately, the justices in <strong>Reid</strong> did not discuss this problem. The rationale seems to be that PSI is “deeply ingrained in the common law” and “lies at the heart of the administration of the criminal law”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> It is not very clear whether the justices were hinting that the PSI has developed beyond a common law principle, such that it is part and parcel of the whole justice system above the reach of courts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Australian position here is questionable at the minimum. It takes an extremely cautious approach: whenever a defendant shows PSI is engaged, a disclosure order would be refused. Is this level of caution necessary to protect the interests of a defendant? If it can be shown that the prosecution will be precluded from relying on information disclosed pursuant to a civil court order, then there should not be a risk to a defendant’s right to fair (criminal) trial. In fact, PSI is not ignored. The only reason why a court would go a step further in precluding the use of disclosed information in a subsequent criminal case is because it had the defendant’s PSI in mind. In such a case, the rationale for upholding PSI seems to drift away, so does the legal reasons for depriving the claimant of its rightful remedies. It can therefore be said that the High Court of Australia failed to pragmatically consider the practical impact of a disclosure order on the defendant’s PSI.</p>

<h5 id="practicality">Practicality</h5>

<p>The E&amp;W approach involves an undertaking from the CPS, which immediately attracts objections based on practicality. The central criticism here is twofold: the first is legal certainty. It is hard to see what incentive the CPS has in giving such undertaking. In fact, there are plenty of disincentives for giving such undertaking, as it may irreparably damage an ongoing investigation or prosecution, on top of increasing their administrative workload. Further, as noted by Professor Neil Andrews, justice is not always done in every case, since it remains the prosecutor’s discretion to order disclosure even if all the legal requirements are satisfied. It is hardly acceptable that whether or not a claimant gets relief depends on the discretion of the prosecutors.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The author agrees with Professor Andrews, consistency is the benefit to both parties here. The defendant should have its basic right protected consistently and not live the fear that the CPS may exercise the discretion against them. Relief for the claimant should also be certain where the legal test for it is satisfied.</p>

<p>The second, more jurisprudential objection, is that the CPS should not be the ultimate arbiter of whether a claimant receives legal redress. The CPS’ decision to give an undertaking will likely be based on how ‘badly’ they want the defendant. This is a consideration alien to the civil dispute between the defendant and claimant. It is outside of the control, and often unknown to both parties. One may say this is like the judge’s consideration of public or legal policy. It is not. The CPS puts its prosecutorial interest first and not the interest of civil justice. The claimant and defendant can have a reasonable idea of the sort of legal/ public policy the judiciary is keen to uphold. The parties cannot know the minds of prosecutors.</p>

<p>In effect then, it may be argued that while there is a jurisprudential basis between the approach adopted by Australian and UK courts, there is no big practical difference in terms of their application. Recall that in <strong>AT&amp;T Istel Ltd</strong>, the majority reiterated an obvious point: that the CPS cannot be bound by a court order Against its will.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> As the CPS is unlikely to give such undertaking (noted there aren’t any comprehensive survey or study on this), the current approach of the E&amp;W courts means most claimants will win an injunction but practically an ineffective one.</p>

<h5 id="justice-and-fairness">Justice and fairness</h5>

<p>The current English approach may also be criticized for standing justice on its own head when a civil court makes an order that’s binding on the criminal court. The majority in <strong>Reid v Howard</strong> stated that “it is inimical to the administration of justice for a civil court to compel self-incriminatory disclosure, while fashioning orders to prevent the use of the information thus obtained in a court vested with criminal jurisdiction with respect to the matters disclosed”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> The majority objects to an order preventing the prosecutor from using such disclosed evidence in criminal prosecution. Lord Wilberforce stated a different concern in <strong>Rank Film</strong>: “I cannot accept that a civil court has any power to decide in a manner which would bind a criminal court that evidence of any kind is admissible or inadmissible in that court.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> His Lordship’s objection is directed at a civil court binding a criminal court. To assess the strength of both objections, it is proposed that one look at <strong>AT&amp;T Istel Ltd</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>AT&amp;T Istel Ltd</strong>, the High Court fashioned an order preventing the use of the information disclosed from being used in criminal prosecution of the defendant. The exact words used are:</p>

<p>“No disclosure made in compliance with paragraphs 18 to 32 inclusive of this order shall be used as evidence in the prosecution of the offence alleged to have been committed by the person required to make that disclosure or by any spouse of that person.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a></p>

<p> Arguably, the wording does not compel the criminal court into rejecting such evidence, but rather it prevents the prosecution, by their own undertaking, from adducing such evidence for the criminal court’s consideration in the first place at the threat of contempt. It is therefore possible to protect both the defendant and claimant’s interest without falling foul of Lord Wilberforce’s concern.</p>

<p>As to the majority’s concern in <strong>Reid</strong>, it is questionable whether it is really “inimical” to justice to order disclosure while limiting its use. It is not uncommon that the use of disclosed information in civil proceedings is limited. For instance, there’s the trite general rule that documents obtained during discovery must be used for the purpose of the litigation at hand only. It is therefore not necessarily against the interest of justice to limit the use of documents to the conduct of the civil litigation.</p>

<h5 id="statutory-reform">Statutory reform</h5>

<p>However, is statute in the form of prevention of use the way to move forward? Of course it depends on the wording of a provision. But any statutory reform must address problems including but not limited to ones discussed in this short piece. Lord Neuberger MR in <strong>Gray</strong><a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> and Professor Andrews<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> supported statutory reform along the lines of section 72(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981. The section applies in a passing off or infringement of IP rights action. The PSI was abrogated and replaced by a prohibition against its use in subsequent prosecution of related criminal offence<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a>. Section 72(3) reads:</p>

<p>“…no statement or admission made by a person—</p>

<p>(a)in answering a question put to him in any proceedings to which subsection (1) applies; or</p>

<p>(b)in complying with any order made in any such proceedings, shall, in proceedings for any related offence or for the recovery of any related penalty, be admissible in evidence against that person…”</p>

<p>It is submitted that there may be two obvious problems for a section 72(3) approach. Firstly, there must be a clear supervision of the scope of disclosure. It should not be used by defendants to disclose evidence not necessarily required under the order. This may potentially become a haven for preventing the prosecution from relying on evidence that should’ve been admissible at trial. One way to do this may add a discretion to the trial judge to allow an evidence if it is clear that such evidence is not so covered under the order. The danger for the defendant is to only disclose what is necessarily required, this can be achieved if the court makes a clear order as to specific information or documents to be disclosed.</p>

<p>Secondly, there does not seem to be a residual discretion to disallow disclosure. Such discretion may be called for, for instance, when the CPS prosecution will likely collapse because of the precluded evidence. It is not unthinkable that the CPS may obtain the evidence from a different source before a disclosure order is made. The order would preclude the use of such independently obtained evidence from being adduced. The interest of the CPS would certainly be undermined by this broad-brush approach. Such a problem cannot be addressed by asking what one values more: catching the bad guys or protecting the innocent. It is a policy consideration that must be undertaken by the legislature.</p>

<p>It is submitted that statutory reform is, however, preferable to existing common law approach. Firstly, it addresses the reluctance of some judges in limiting the common law PSI right. This benefit is perhaps less important in England &amp; Wales since the highest court has not shared such concern. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, statutory reform would solve the practicality objection. The CPS will no longer be the <em>de facto</em> arbiter of whether a claimant gets a relief where the defendant asserts PSI. It also means that the legal certainty objection is also met. Of course, this is assuming Parliament reforms the law along the lines of section 72(3). Secondly, it addresses the problem of the E&amp;W approach where the CPS retains a discretion which ultimately affects whether the claimant gets the disclosure order. As noted above, the court cannot bind the CPS unless the CPS gives a voluntary undertaking to court. Such that the effect of the E&amp;W approach is not so different to the Australian one since the CPS has little incentive to give such undertaking. A statutory provision would resolve this current discrepancy between principle and practice.</p>

<p>Taking stock from the foregoing discussion, it is hoped the readers are at least persuaded the current common law approaches (both E&amp;W and Australia) are problematic and needs urgent reform. The PSI deserves protection by our legal system, yet it should be relied on to categorically undermine the effectiveness of civil process. Since courts cannot bind the prosecution without its consent, statutory reform is needed to ensure the aim of PSI is served: to prevent use of disclosed information in subsequent criminal prosecution of the defendant for a related offence. It is prime time for this reform.</p>

<p>The UK’s first deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) was made at the end of last year. After extensive negotiations in an African bribery case, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) agreed terms with Standard Bank Plc for the payment of a significant financial penalty and Lord Justice Leveson, sitting as a Judge of the Crown Court at Southwark, gave judgement confirming that the settlement served the public interest in the particular circumstances of the case.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></p>

<p>Under a DPA, criminal proceedings are instituted against a company but then they are immediately suspended under the condition that the company pays a significant financial penalty and implements a corporate compliance programme. When these conditions have been satisfied, the criminal proceedings are discontinued and the company avoids a criminal conviction against its name. DPAs have been popular tools for resolving cases involving corporate criminal activity in the US, and after much consideration section 45 and schedule 17 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 were enacted to enable this type of agreement to be made in the UK.</p>

<p>However, opinions are sharply divided regarding the place of DPAs in the criminal justice system. For some, DPAs represent ‘a corrupt law enforcement regime which threatens a loss of respect for the rule of law’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> But for others DPAs offer an elegant solution by which the criminal justice system can respond to corporate misconduct within a positive framework that encourages improvements according to the standards of corporate governance. As an editorial in The Times recently pointed out,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> DPAs can help the SFO’s enforcement policy become more “muscular” by sparing the expense of a full criminal investigation and the possibility of a humiliating acquittal if prosecution is pursued through the criminal courts.</p>

<p>It is easy for critics to call for more pro-active corporate prosecutions in the UK through the criminal courts, but obtaining criminal convictions for substantive offences, particularly in cases involving allegations of bribery and corruption, is not easy as a result of the continuing adherence to the corporate identification or corporate attribution rule. This rule provides that a company cannot be guilty of a criminal offence unless it can be shown beyond reasonable doubt that a director or senior officer who represented ‘the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation’ was involved in the offending conduct (Lennard’s Carrying Co v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> In the modern age of monolithic companies with cross-border operations, it is often difficult if not impossible for the SFO to obtain probative evidence to this effect.</p>

<p>The facts in R v Standard Bank Plc reflect a case in point. In September 2012, Standard Bank (a UK regulated bank) together with its subsidiary bank Stanbic Bank Tanzania Ltd (a Tanzanian company based in Dar es Salaam) agreed with the Tanzanian Government to raise funds for its five-year development plan. The agreement provided that one per cent of the fee payable to Standard Bank amounting to $6 million would be remitted to a local partner in Tanzania called Enterprise Growth Market Advisors Limited (EGMA). EGMA’s directors and shareholders were senior figures in the Tanzanian Government, and there was a clear inference that the purpose of the payment was to encourage these figures to use their influence to persuade the Tanzanian Government into making the agreement with Standard Bank and its subsidiary company. Two senior members of Stanbic Bank based in Tanzania, who must have appreciated that EGMA had no role to play in the financing agreement, negotiated the agreement. However, before proceeding to make the agreement Standard Bank omitted to conduct any due diligence enquiries on the local partner company, believing it was not necessary in the circumstances. Plainly, on any view, this was a massive error of judgment by Standard Bank. In any event, after Stanbic Bank paid $6 million to EGMA, employees at Stanbic Bank raised concerns about the propriety of the payment. These concerns were relayed to Standard Bank and following an initial investigation Standard Bank self-reported its preliminary findings to the SFO.</p>

<p>As the DPA recognised, the evidence pointed towards a breach of section 7(1) of the Bribery Act 2010, with an indictment alleging that Standard Bank had failed to prevent persons associated with the bank, namely Stanbic Bank and the negotiators, from committing bribery. The evidence also suggested that Standard Bank would experience difficulty in any attempt to establish the statutory defence in section 7(2) of the Bribery Act 2010, which would require Standard Bank to have adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with the Bank from committing bribery. The upshot was that Standard Bank agreed to pay compensation to the Tanzanian Government of $6 million plus interest, disgorge its profit on the agreement of $8.4 million and pay a financial penalty of $16 million.</p>

<p>As well as avoiding prosecution and possible criminal conviction by making the DPA, Standard Bank was able to avoid acceptance of any liability for committing a substantive bribery offence. A criminal conviction establishing that a Standard Bank employee had assisted in the commission of a bribery offence would have been very damaging in reputational terms, and the Bank’s future profitability would have been adversely affected. Instead, as Lord Justice Leveson’s judgment makes clear, there was no allegation against Standard Bank of knowing participation in an offence of bribery, and the offence was limited to an allegation of inadequate systems to prevent associated persons from committing an offence of bribery. <a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>In truth, the SFO was hamstrung. As Lord Justice Leveson explained: ‘The SFO has reached the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that any of Standard Bank’s employees committed an offence: whilst a payment of $6 million was made available to EGMNA, the evidence does not demonstrate with the appropriate cogency that anyone within Standard Bank knew that two senior executives of Stanbic intended the payment to constitute a bribe, or so intended it themselves’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a></p>

<p>At this point, it is interesting to bear in mind the response of the Tanzanian authorities to the corruption investigation. Apparently, according to the information contained in Lord Justice Leveson’s judgment, the authorities in Tanzania had been informed of the DPA and did not make any objection to it. In fact, the Judge observed, the Tanzanian authorities were supportive of the settlement and have done nothing to undermine it. This is faint praise indeed. But it is less than helpful from the SFO’s perspective since if an effective case of bribery were to be mounted against Standard Bank, the negotiators in Stanbic Bank or the EGMA directors, key evidence from Tanzania would be required. It is possible to show transfers of money between accounts on the face of banking documents, but this is often an arid exercise, especially where it is not entirely clear why a particular transfer has been made. As the lawyer Billy Flynn explains to the Judge in the musical Chicago when Velma Kelly takes the stand, if a criminal case is going to be successful a jury needs to be told a story – some of the ‘old razzle dazzle’. And it is difficult to tell a story without any of the key witnesses attending trial to give evidence.</p>

<p>Against this background, whilst the DPA made between the SFO and Standard Bank may not represent a perfect resolution, unquestionably the outcome is better than nothing. Apart from anything else, it enables the SFO to send out a message that Africa’s largest bank is not immune from criminal process in the UK, and if it wants to keep out of trouble in the future it needs to raise its standards of corporate governance. Whatever the critics may say, this is definitely a step towards the right direction.</p>
