	     <h5 id="introduction">Introduction </h5>

<p>The invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in the advent of the <em>Schrems II</em> case raises a plethora of concerns for the UK’s free flow of data to the European Economic Area (EEA) post-Brexit. With the instant invalidation of the Privacy Shield agreement relied upon by over 5000 corporations within the EU and the US<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a>, transborder data flows have been severely affected as a result of mandating heightened data protection assessments when transferring data out of the EU. This blog piece aims to analyse the <em>Schrems II</em> case and its application to the UK’s current data protection regime to determine if the UK will be granted an ‘adequacy status’. It will assess the UK’s legislative responses to jurisprudence from the Court of Justice of the European Union and discuss how these may act as impediments which prevent the European Commission from reaching an adequacy decision. Finally, this article will evaluate the implications of not being granted an ‘adequacy status’ on the UK’s transborder data flows to the EU upon the expiry of the transition period.    </p>

<h5 id="1-what-is-an-adequacy-status-and-why-does-it-matter">1) What is an ‘adequacy status’ and why does it matter? </h5>

<p>An ‘adequacy status’ is granted by the European Commission to non-EU countries – which are known as third countries wishing to have free and unimpeded data flow within the European Economic Area. It is granted when a third country’s data protection regime is deemed to provide a level of protection which is ‘essentially  equivalent’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> to EU law. In evaluating the third country’s legal regime, the European Commission looks at, <em>inter alia</em>, the extent to which the rule of law respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, the means of judicial redress afforded to data subjects and the effective functioning of an independent supervisory authority enforcing compliance with data protection rules.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></p>

<p>With the UK becoming a ‘third country’ vis-à-vis the EU, not being granted an adequacy status by the European Commission would result in companies having to resort to alternative methods of legal compliance under the GDPR. Therefore, analysing the legislative frameworks pertaining to the UK in light of <em>Schrems II</em> will allow for the extrapolation of whether such frameworks might be deemed adequate by the European Commission. </p>

<p>Analysing whether the UK will be granted an adequacy status also matters in the context of the UK being provided with a six month interim period by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> which stipulates terms on which the EU and the UK will trade following the end of the implementation period on the 31st of December. The Agreement provides that for an interim period lasting 6 months (from the 1st of January 2021), data flows from the EEA to the UK will not be considered as transfers to a third country under EU law. Therefore, the UK has an additional 6 months to ensure that their data protection laws are fully compatible with <em>Schrems II</em> upon the expiry of the interim period.  </p>

<h5 id="2-will-the-uk-be-granted-an-adequacy-status-in-light-ofschrems-ii">2) Will the UK be granted an ‘adequacy status’ in light of <em>Schrems II</em>? </h5>

<p>The <em>Schrems II</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> case arose following the CJEU’s invalidation of the Safe Harbour Agreement in <em>Schrems I</em> in 2015 and concerned a complaint against Facebook. Privacy advocate Max Schrems contended that US surveillance schemes processing data transferred from Facebook Ireland Ltd. to its parent company in the US, Facebook Inc. conflicts with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the rights enshrined in the European Charter of Human Rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> While <em>Schrems II</em> was concerned with surveillance schemes adopted by US security agencies and their nonconformity with EU law, the principles elucidated by the CJEU can shed light as to whether an adequacy decision might be granted to the UK.</p>

<h6 id="grounds-for-the-invalidation-of-the-eu-us-privacy-shield"><u>Grounds for the Invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield</u> </h6>

<p>In <em>Schrems II</em>, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated on two grounds. </p>

<h6 id="a-the-mass-surveillance-of-data-by-us-agencies"><u>(a) The mass surveillance of data by US Agencies</u></h6>

<p>The mass surveillance of data by section 702 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Executive Order 12333 permit the collection of information from EU data subjects in bulk to obtain foreign intelligence information. In <em>Schrems II</em>, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that the surveillance of EU data has not been limited to what is strictly necessary<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> thus breaching the principle of proportionality.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> In particular, the CJEU ruled that Art. 7 and 8 of the Charter<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> stipulating the right to private and family life and protection of personal data respectively were violated as the interference with EU data subjects’ rights and freedoms for national security purposes “go beyond the restrictions necessary in a democratic society”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a>   </p>

<p>Applying this to the UK, it is questionable whether UK national security and surveillance law is proportionate to its restrictions. A historical chronology of the development of UK legislative frameworks on surveillance would further illustrate this.                    </p>

<h6 id="requirements-for-data-interception-under-the-investigatory-powers-act"><em>Requirements for Data Interception under the Investigatory Powers Act</em></h6>

<p>Following the enactment of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) in 2014, the <em>Tele2/Watson</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> case challenging UK and Swedish data retention laws concluded that the DRIPA framework does not comply with the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58. In particular, the court held that DRIPA’s legislative framework breached the requirement of retaining data to prevent a “serious risk” to public security and permitted warrants for bulk acquisition of data without notifying individuals that their data was being accessed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Three criteria can be extracted from the CJEU judgment on how DRIPA had to be reformed to comply with the e-Privacy Directive:<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>     </p>

<p>(i)           Security Intelligence Agencies (SIAs) must access metadata for a narrow set of purposes </p>

<p>(ii)          Prior independent review must take place before authorising data interception</p>

<p>(iii)         Data acquisition/retention must be proportionate and targeted towards specific data subjects who must be informed of their data being processed  </p>

<p>Arguably, the first criteria has been addressed because a narrow set of purposes has been stipulated in the IPA about metadata that can be retained by SIAs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> An exhaustive list has been added to the IPA whereby processing must be justified according to one of six purposes including “interests of national security” and an “applicable crime purpose”. The second criterion has been also addressed through the IPA by introducing a “double lock” for the interception of warrants whereby warrants/notices must be approved by the Secretary of State and subsequently by the Investigatory Powers Commission prior to being authorised for use in data retention.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> This introduced a more robust framework for authorising the use of warrants for data interception.    </p>

<p>However, the third criteria extrapolated from the judgement has not been met as the Act stipulates that the Secretary of State’s power to authorise a warrant would be considered proportionate as long as data retention is justified according to one of six purposes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> This fails to ensure that data retention is targeted to certain data subjects or a specific class of individuals whose data must be processed according to the justified purpose.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> This is analogous to s.702 FISA discussed in <em>Schrems II</em> where data retention was not targeted and consequently found to be disproportionate. It is therefore clear that both the US and UK data protection SIAs use “national security” as a blanket defence for disproportionate processing of data in bulk. Furthermore, s.174 of the IPA makes it an offence for telecommunication providers to disclose to any person, “without reasonable excuse”, the contents of a warrant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> The Act potentially implies that informing data subjects of their data being processed is an offence unless authorised by the Secretary of State. This will likely act as an impediment to being granted an adequacy status as the legislation’s default position should be informing data subjects unless there is a legitimate reason not to. </p>

<p>In light of the previous analysis which highlights that the IPA framework fails to ensure proportionate data acquisition that is transparently disclosed to all affected data subjects, the response of the minister of State for Media and Data<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> to the questions posed by the European Scrutiny Committee is concerning. By praising the IPA as “robust, transparent and world-leading”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a>, Sir William Cash MP seems give too much merit to the UK legislative framework given the third criterion from the <em>Tele2/Watson</em> judgement that has not been addressed.</p>

<h6 id="national-security-considerations-in-the-investigatory-powers-act"><em>National Security Considerations in the Investigatory Powers Act</em> </h6>

<p>The IPA framework has been deemed indiscriminate and disproportionate for protecting national security in the <em>Privacy International</em> case.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> In the case, Privacy International, a UK based charity defending rights to privacy bought a case before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the UK Security<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> and Intelligence<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Agencies challenging the legality of processing bulk communications within the IPA framework due to not being compliant with the E-Privacy Directive and not fully addressing issues identified by <em>Tele2/Watson. </em>However, the UK government argued that the E-privacy Directive does not apply to its processing activities as according to Art.4(2) of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a>, “national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state”. Since processing occurred for national security purposes, the UK government argued that the E-Privacy Directive does not apply due to national security falling outside the competency of EU law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> While the CJEU focused on whether EU law has primacy over data processing in the context of national security,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> it also considered whether general and indiscriminate retention of data is permissible under national security purposes as a secondary point. </p>

<p>Regarding the question of whether national security falls within the competence of EU law, the CJEU ruled that while it is the responsibility of Member States to determine their own security measures, such measures must be in accordance with EU law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> However, in <em>Schrems II</em>, the CJEU precluded the application of Art.4(2) TEU to the US legal regime as the US is not an EU Member State.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Therefore, while both <em>Schrems II </em>and <em>Privacy International </em>concerned data processing in the context of ‘national security’, it is clear that the UK government availed of the applicability of the TEU to exclude the disproportionate processing of bulk data by SIAs from the scope of EU law. This, however, will no longer be the case because the UK can no longer take advantage of TEU following the expiry of the transition period. </p>

<p>However, the CJEU in <em>Privacy International </em>affirmed the applicability of EU law to SIAs processing activities and reiterate what has been discussed in the <em>Schrems II</em> CJEU judgement regarding general and indiscriminate data collection by SIAs for national security purposes, whereby data processing must be proportionate, strictly necessary and targeted according to Art. 15(1) of the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> Therefore, while <em>Privacy International</em> did not evaluate the substantive flaws of the IPA framework, analysing it in conjunction with <em>Schrems II</em> affirms that more robust safeguards for data subjects in the context of national security must be put in place for the UK and the US to be deemed to provide a level of protection “essentially equivalent” to EU law. Contextualising this with <em>Tele2/Watson </em>shows that the IPA framework must address the criteria extracted from the judgment for Sir William Cash MP to describe the IPA as “robust, transparent and world-leading”.</p>

<h6 id="considerations-under-the-eu-uk-trade-agreement"><em>Considerations under the EU-UK Trade Agreement</em> </h6>

<p>It is vital to draw to attention that Article FINPROV.10A of the EU-UK Trade Agreement<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> stipulates that if the UK changes its data protection law for reasons other than complying with the EU data protection regime, the interim period automatically comes to an end and the UK becomes a third country vis-à-vis the EU. It is arguable that through this provision, the UK is promising not to use bulk interception of data for national security reasons as the incompatibility of this with EU law has been affirmed through CJEU jurisprudence in <em>Privacy International</em>. Nevertheless, the UK agreeing not to use bulk interception of data is not enough for being granted an adequacy finding upon the expiry of such period.  </p>

<p>Therefore, it is concluded that in order to ensure that the processing of data is proportionate and strictly necessary according to <em>Schrems II</em>, the IPA must address the substantive issues raised in <em>Tele2/Watson </em>by ensuring that data retention is proportionate and targeted, whilst safeguarding data subjects’ by making them fully aware of their data being processed. Hence, at its current form, the IPA framework is not fully “robust, transparent and world-leading”. With the interim period ending on the 1st of July and no reforms being enacted, both judgements read in light of <em>Schrems II </em>present a major setback for the UK obtaining an adequacy decision (pursuant to Art. 45, GDPR).      </p>

<h6 id="bmeans-for-judicial-redress"><u>(b)  Means for Judicial Redress</u></h6>

<p>The second ground as to why the EU-US Privacy Shield was nullified relates to insufficient means for judicial redress. The creation of the Ombudsperson under the Privacy Shield was declared insufficient by the CJEU because individuals are not able to bring legal action before an impartial and independent court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> The CJEU justified this point by stating that the “ombudsperson is appointed by the Secretary of State and is an integral part of the US State Department”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a>thereby alluding to the fact that the judicial body (ombudsperson) is not free from the pressure of the executive. This is detrimental to the impartiality of the ombudsperson who is not able to exert autonomy when making judgements. Furthermore, the CJEU state that although recital 120 of the Privacy Shield agreement stipulates the commitment of the US Government to ensuring that the “Privacy Shield Ombudsperson” corrects violations from SIAs, no provision in the agreement affirms or indicates the “power” of the ombudsperson to adopt decisions that are legally binding on SIAs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> In light of these issues, the CJEU ruled that the level of protection afforded by the ombudsperson is not “essentially equivalent” to EU law which enshrines a “right to an effective remedy and fair trial” through Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> As such, two criteria can be extracted from the <em>Schrems II</em> case that must be met for the UK to be granted an adequacy status: (1) that the judicial body responsible for data surveillance issues must be independent and impartial and (2) that the judicial body must have the power to issue legally binding decisions. </p>

<p>Starting with the first criteria, it is clear that an independent tribunal, specifically, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has been exclusively empowered to hear complaints against the regime and provide redress. This is affirmed through the case of <em>Big Brothers Watch v UK</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> which concerned, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the IPT complies with Article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Since the convention has been woven into EU jurisprudence through the European Charter of Human Rights<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a>, the case provides salient observations on the impartiality of the IPT. The ECtHR ruled that the IPT functions as an independent body and that hosting meetings with Security Services such as MI5 does not undermine the tribunal’s impartiality insofar as fairness, justice and procedural regularity for court hearings are concerned.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> The ECtHR additionally ruled that the tribunal is exempt from having public hearings in instances where information disclosed from parties pertains to national security and that this does not infringe on the transparency of the tribunal and thus its impartiality in the eyes of the public.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a></p>

<p>Moving to the second criteria, the ability of the IPT to issue legally binding decisions against the executive branch (i.e. government) is evidenced through the case of <em>Liberty</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a>. The IPT ruled in the case that Article 8 and Article 10 of the ECHR enshrining the right to private and family life and the right to freedom of expression respectively have not been “in accordance with the law”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> as necessary in a democratic society and have thus been violated. <em>Liberty</em> was the first case ruled by the IPT that was found against the government and proved that the judicial framework for redress is more effective than the ombudsperson mechanism in the US as the executive branch can be held accountable when contravening the law. The effectiveness of the IPT in being able to challenge the executive is furthermore demonstrated in the case of <em>Belhadj &amp; Others</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> where Security Services’ surveillance schemes (operating under the auspices of the government) were found to contravene the Regulation of the Investigatory Powers Act 2000.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a></p>

<p>Another indication that does not directly fall within the <em>Schrems II </em>independent tribunal criteria but could act as an advantage for the UK being granted an adequacy is section 242 of the Investigatory Powers Act 2018,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> which allows parties to appeal from decisions concluded in the IPT to the Court of Appeal. This domestic route of appeal ostensibly provides individuals with further access to judicial redress which is a promising step towards the UK being granted an adequacy decision.    </p>

<p>As such, the UK has an effective judicial redress framework and this could act as an advantage when the European Commission considers granting the adequacy status.   </p>

<h5 id="3-what-if-the-uk-is-not-granted-an-adequacy-status">3) What if the UK is not granted an ‘adequacy status’? </h5>

<p>If the UK is not granted an ‘adequacy status’, companies wishing to import/export data from the EEA must resort to alternative methods of legal compliance such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> The case holds that companies using SCCs must implement additional safeguards by assessing SCCs on a case-by-case basis in context of the third country’s legal regime.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> Despite the ICO amending the SCC template following <em>Schrems II</em> to maximise protection by design,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> corporations do not have any guidelines as to how they can assess data exports. This creates practical difficulties for UK corporations relying on SCCs (in the event of no adequacy being granted) as they are obliged by the <em>Schrems II</em> judgement to revisit their terms to establish a comprehensive framework not undermining data subjects’ rights under Art. 44,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> albeit with no guidelines from the ICO on how such protection can be fulfilled.  With such an onerous burden, corporations will likely apply divergent levels of understanding when assessing data exports which runs the risk of not achieving the wider GDPR policy objective of data protection. However, the severity of this burden in light of the <em>Schrems II </em>case remains unaffected in the context of UK companies as firstly, the UK will not be regarded as a third country during the six-month interim period according to the EU-UK Trade Agreement and secondly, the UK legislature has transposed GDPR laws locally through the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications statutory instrument<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> which mirrors the GDPR and thus evidences the UK’s continued compliance with EU law and jurisprudence in <em>Schrems II</em>.</p>

<p>Given the fact that BCRs create legally binding internal rules for data transfers approved by a data protection authority in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR, they are seen as a more feasible and durable method of alternative legal compliance due to not being subject to the same protective standard applied to SCCs in <em>Schrems II</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> UK companies relying on BCRs enjoy a greater deal of flexibility as the competent supervisory authority does not need to evidence ‘non-material updates to BCRs’ thus saving time and costs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> However, it should be noted that BCRs are not practically useful as they exclusively apply to data transfers within a corporate group.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> The practical utility of BCRs may thus be limited because they cannot enable wider data transfers outside the corporate groups. </p>

<p>Art. 49 derogations<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> are an alternative method of legal compliance that can be applied to a very limited set of circumstances and can be used when SCCs or BCRs cannot be utilised. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) applies stringent criteria when authorising data transfers under Art. 49 derogations whereby the transborder transfer of data must be strictly necessary for one of seven derogations recognised by the EBDP.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> For instance, if the derogation relied upon is “necessary for the performance of a contract”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> the EBDP must establish, <em>inter alia</em>, a “close and substantial connection between the transfer and purpose of the contract”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> The stringent criteria applied by the EBDP when authorising data transfers under Art.49 derogations indicate that they must be used as a last resort and are thus not of practical utility to firms in the event of no adequacy being granted.   </p>

<p>Hence, it seems SCCs  are the only option which corporations can rely on for data transfers to the EEA in the event of no adequacy being granted; although their application remains highly uncertain in light of <em>Schrems II</em>.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>This blog piece aims to shed light on the implications of the <em>Schrems II </em>case on post-Brexit data flows in the context of cases decided by the CJEU that highlight areas that must undergo legislative reform to ensure an adequacy status is granted.  Since the interim period stipulated in the EU-UK Trade Agreement is due to expire on the 1st of July, the UK parliament has a six-month period through which it must urgently enact legislative reforms following issues raised in <em>Schrems II</em> concerning proportionality of data processing as well as issues regarding indiscriminate retention of bulk data and the lack of safeguards in the IPA framework according to <em>Privacy International</em> and <em>Tele2/Watson</em> to ensure an adequacy status is granted. It is concluded that in the event of no adequacy being granted upon the expiry of the interim period, companies seeking unencumbered EU-UK data flows must rely on alternative methods of legal compliance. Given the narrow transfer of data within the remit of BCRs and the stringent criteria applied to Art. 49 derogations which must be used as a last resort, companies have no choice but to rely on SCCs which create onerous burdens on firms given the lack of guidance from data protection authorities including the ICO.</p>

	     <h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>

<p><em>The past November marked the 75th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg Trials, a milestone that the Tokyo Trial will in turn reach next May. These two proceedings instituted the long-awaited birth of international criminal justice, after the frustrated trial of Kaiser Wilhelm II following the Great War and the Treaty of Versailles. From the very outset, images played a fundamental role in shaping international criminal justice before its audience. This article analyses how the use of visual elements (i.e., the depiction of victim suffering) has been instrumental in driving international criminal justice – and, therefore, law – in certain directions, whereas censorship (i.e., the depiction of victimlessness) has contributed to the avoidance of undesired paths. I argue that this manipulation through image has been utilised to build a conscience of humankind and thus achieve greater legitimacy of international criminal law in its inaugural trials, while attempting to conceal one of the greatest pitfalls of the field: selectivity.</em></p>

<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>

<p>The trials of Nuremberg and Tokyo in 1945/1946 set in motion a system that, albeit with significant hiatuses, has been running for 75 years: international criminal justice. Even though these were two (obviously) distinct legal proceedings, Gerry Simpson has coined the term ‘Tokyoberg’ to refer to the twinned trials,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> which can be analysed as a single event where multiple revolutions occurred in the way we understand, and articulate, concepts such as individual responsibility, the criminalisation of war, and the invention of crimes against humanity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> I will make use of the Tokyobergian idea throughout the essay.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, international legal scholars conceptualised how international criminal justice, despite the contentions for its universality, had in fact been highly selective. McCormack asserted that selectivity is first found in relation to the acts the international community characterises as crimes and, secondly, in relation to the particular alleged atrocities that international criminal justice collectively prosecutes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> Simpson argued that a fundamental requirement of the rule of law is generality, and therefore the selective application of international criminal law entails a serious flaw in the international legal system itself and an impediment to the just application of these laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Bothe identified that states are very cautious when creating law enforcement mechanisms that could potentially assert jurisdiction over their nationals, while conversely applying much wider views of liability in ‘safe’ frameworks (i.e., in situations where the exercise of jurisdiction over their own nationals is unlikely).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>Fast forward to the 2010s – now with a permanent International Criminal Court operating for some years – a group of scholars studied a phenomenon which, as they found, had been instrumental in developing international criminal law: the utilisation of images. Schwöbel-Patel observed that international criminal tribunals, probably more than any other international institutions, have relied on videos and other forms of images to narrate their purpose and showcase the discipline of international criminal law and its main protagonists.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> Tallgren remarked that there is a relationship between images of suffering from ‘atrocity’ and the desired support for international criminal justice: seeking empathy and commitment to action by images is a frequent practice of humanitarianism and international criminal law gives special attention to victimhood.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> As she puts it, ‘images and international criminal justice make an enigmatic couple’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this essay is to combine the concepts of selectivity and imagery, by analysing the ways in which they intertwined in the emergence of international criminal justice. Today, 75 years after Tokyoberg, international criminal law still finds itself struggling to enhance its legitimacy by resorting to representational narratives<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> – a technique that goes back a long way. I do not intend to add to the criticism about the great, routine failures of the field, or, as it was recently construed, become another ‘pragmatist pointing out the obvious defects in the system’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Rather, this essay will trace back to the origins of international criminal justice to focus on how visual elements were utilised or discarded in Tokyoberg to exploit audiences and masquerade the well-known selectivity. The result, I argue, is the engineered dichotomic portrayal of, either, deeply tormented victims, or no victims at all.</p>

<h5 id="the-conscience-of-humankind-legalism-through-imagery">‘The Conscience of Humankind’: Legalism Through Imagery</h5>

<p>Nouwen and Werner illustrate that when an international criminal court is involved, the primary concern becomes ‘convincing the international community that justice is done’; that is, that the form of justice preferred by the international community is done.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Contrasted with the notion of ‘global justice’, other conceptions of law appear as particular, local and traditional.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Therefore, one of the objectives of international criminal law is to monopolise the prevailing discourses of such global justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> In <em>Tokyoberg</em>, this pursuit was evident.</p>

<p>Hartley Shawcross, Chief British prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, argued that ‘international law has in the past made some claim that there is a limit to the omnipotence of the state and that the individual … is not disentitled to the protection of mankind when the state tramples upon his rights in a manner which outrages the conscience of mankind.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> In a similar vein, Telford Taylor, the American lawyer who acted as Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg, addressed the judges by saying: ‘… we are not now indicting the German General Staff at the bar of history, but on specific charges of crimes against international law and the dictates of the conscience of mankind, as embodied in the Charter which governs this Court.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> The phrasing ‘conscience of mankind’ had originated at Versailles and re-emerged years later to underpin the effective kick-off of the international criminal justice system.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> This effort to construct a global justice to foster the protection of an overarching moral humanity earned, on the one hand, the praise of the philosopher Karl Jaspers – who saw the trials as a possibility to reorient Germany to the tradition of humanism as well as a renewal of the tradition of Western humanism itself for a cosmopolitan future – and, on the other, the mistrust of Hannah Arendt – who thought the social construction of moral or criminal guilt would exonerate not only Germans but humanity from the need for a more profound ethical and political response.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a></p>

<p>The narratives behind international criminal justice attempted to offset the weaknesses of the system (such as the concerns about victors’ justice and <em>ex post facto </em>criminal law) by appealing to the moral conscience of humanity, an allegedly global-shared value which was so superior, so intrinsic to the human being, that its damage could not be tolerated. This principle stemmed from the recognition of the supremacy of the law of humanity over the law of a sovereign state when it violates elementary human rights; particularly in a manner which may justly be held to shock the conscience of humankind.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Consequently, the merged notions of ‘conscience’ and ‘humankind’ offered a creative way out of the predicaments of inexistent positive criminal law, and thus became the legal basis buttressing legality in <em>Tokyoberg</em>. In parallel, victims became fundamental to reinforcing the theory of a damaged conscience and its need for redress. Invoking victimhood generally comes with a claim to authority, a claim that one is entitled to speak on behalf of the category of the actual victims, and on behalf of the abstract victim (i.e., humankind).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> This authority is also a claim to ‘authorship’, namely the power to write the story – and history – of victims in a particular way.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a></p>

<p>Against this background, imagery played a crucial role in the development of monopolistic legitimising discourses. Photographs and videos of victims have been used in international criminal justice to draw attention to selected acts that <em>must</em> shock the conscience of humankind, whereas other visuals have been deliberately concealed to sterilise the shocking capacity of the acts that they portrayed. The power culminates in shaping the focus: some suffering gets selected, passes through the elaborate international criminal justice procedural rites, is purified, and becomes confirmed as worthy of concern.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>Through this theoretical lens, the following sections examine the exhibition/concealment of imagery in the aftermath of the Second World War.</p>

<h5 id="ii-conscience-and-the-imagery-of-atrocity-intokyoberg">II. Conscience and the Imagery of Atrocity in <em>Tokyoberg</em></h5>

<p>The Allied powers were in need to forward the concept of global justice for the legitimacy of the trials. The task came not without dangers: the ghosts of <em>ex post facto</em> law and <em>ad hocery</em>, in addition to the sceptical – now contradictory – views that many Allies had had towards trying the Kaiser, threatened the success of the project. Versailles had been surrounded by a certain aversion to resorting to a law-rooted legitimacy for William II’s trial, to the extent that Article 227 included all kinds of euphemisms for ‘law’, but never the exact word. In this vein, Clemenceau wrote in 1920 that this “was not a case of a public accusation fundamentally of a legal character, but of an act of high international policy demanded by the conscience of mankind”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>In <em>Tokyoberg</em>, 25 years later, the legalistic approach attained much more preponderance. As Simpson contends, ‘Roosevelt was worrying about acquittals on technicalities and Robert Jackson – pressed on the existence of crimes against humanity or aggression – replied by saying “we can save ourselves from these pitfalls of definition if our test of what is a crime gives recognition to those things which fundamentally outrage the conscience of the American people.” The victims of war crimes had become the people in general … This became at trial the idea of “shocking the conscience of mankind.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The trial was understood as an exercise in the reconstitution of the law, an act staged not only to punish extreme crimes but to demonstrate the power of the law to submit the most horrific outrages to the hand of justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> In this regard, the trial was to serve as a spectacle of legality, making visible both the crimes of the Germans and the neutral authority of the rule of law: the idiom of judgment on this point took the form of ‘crimes against humanity’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a></p>

<p>The situation presented other hurdles for the United States as well. International criminal law was supposed to redress the egregious acts carried out by the Nazi and Japanese regimes, and the core legitimacy to try the perpetrators was contained in the shocking capacity of those deeds of moral turpitude. But how could the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, crimes equally capable of shocking consciences, be left out? The Americans were not the only ones facing these quandaries, as the British carried the burden of the carpet bombings of several German cities (causing more than 300,000 civilian deaths)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> and the Soviets faced responsibility for the terrible Katyn Massacre, among others.</p>

<p>In this delicate scenario, the portrayal of images to audiences was meticulously designed. Which events to expose graphically, and which to hide, became a matter that the victor states carefully calculated in parallel to the <em>Tokyobergian </em>implementation. This exploitation was instrumental in perfecting the legalism that was needed as a pillar of the trials. Michalczyk presents a thorough review of the usage of visual elements before and during Nuremberg, where accounts in the form of both photographs and movies were broadcasted to a big portion of the world’s population, especially to those affected by the war.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a></p>

<p>In February 1945, some months after the first camps were liberated by the Soviets, a director working for the British Ministry of Information Film Division contacted the Allied Psychological Warfare Division in order to collect and produce material ‘with a view to preparing a film which will show the German atrocities in many parts of the world’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> By June, camps had also been discovered by the Allies advancing from the West. The Anglo-German newsreel ‘Welt im Film’ (‘The World on Film’) was released, explicitly depicting the atrocities in a series of graphic scenes from concentration camps. Its showcase became part of the denazification plan, encompassing the message ‘Dass ist Faschismus, dass ist Nationalsozialismus’ (‘That is Fascism, that is National Socialism’).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Screenings were made compulsory in Allied-occupied Germany.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a></p>

<p>In September 1945, Robert Jackson, Chief US Prosecutor at Nuremberg, personally reviewed a film called ‘That Justice Be Done’ (produced by the Office of Strategic Services and also translated to German) and believed that the short documentary would be a means of educating the public about the rationale for an international trial. Released in theatres in October, the film allowed Americans to view on screen the oppressive Nazi rule in the context of the ideals of the American system of justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> The US Signal Corps were instructed to document extensively – and vividly – the results of the Nazi monstruous atrocities, producing photos and films that were designed to ‘document history as well as inform an incredulous world that lay unaware of the concentration camp nightmare.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, the Soviets also did their part. During the trial they presented significant amounts of film evidence showing the civilians that had been massacred in various Nazi camps. The piles of corpses and emaciated prisoners were displayed explicitly. In the minds of the Soviets, the presentation of this footage of atrocities at Nuremberg would further assure that their victimhood at the hands of the Nazis would be viewed in an international forum. This compilation of four reels of material, lasting approximately one hour, screened for the Tribunal, included the newsreels and documentaries which had already been shown in Russian theatres.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> The footage established an important narrative in which Soviet images of Nazi atrocities predominated, in addition to depictions of the triumphant marches of the Red Army.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> Hicks reflects that ‘propaganda was inextricably entwined with atrocity; indeed, the latter would not have been shown without the former.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a></p>

<p>The Nuremberg trial spectacle included not only films and photographs of victims, but actual victims’ remains. ‘The shrunken head of Buchenwald’ – a fist-sized human head with the skull bone removed, stuffed, and preserved – was exhibited in the courtroom as vivid proof of the barbarous Nazi experiments. The scholar Lawrence Douglas has analysed the prosecution’s rhetoric around the shrunken head, in connection to the legalistic discourse that acted as bedrock to the ‘crimes against humanity’ limb of the accusation. The cranium, Douglas concludes, served as the most tangible representation of Nazi crimes as atavistic: an unquestionable testimony that the acts performed at the camps belonged to an era that predated civilisation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> Therefore, law was meant to act as the protector of a civilised humankind. In Robert Jackson’s words: ‘If we cannot eliminate the causes and prevent the repetition of these barbaric events, it is not an irresponsible prophecy to say that this twentieth century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Photos of the shrunken head became some of the best-known images associated with the trial.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a></p>

<p>The fact that great part of the visual testimonies was not only used at the trials, but also broadcasted to the general population, speaks significantly about the intention that underlay the juridical necessity of presenting evidence that could not only contribute to the criminal conviction of the accused, but also outrage the civilised conscience. Schwöbel-Patel’s theory on spectacle in international criminal law is an applicable framework to reflect the logic behind <em>Tokyoberg</em>: ‘Understanding victims of international crime as spectacularized directs attention to the visual and rhetorical signification of the social construction of victimhood … and more broadly to the understanding of international criminality and its apparent antithesis of humanitarianism.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> The creation of images – and their timely distribution – became part of the legitimising machinery claiming for justice to be done in <em>Tokyoberg</em>.</p>

<h5 id="iii-the-mushroom-cloud-censorship-in-occupied-japan">III. ‘The Mushroom Cloud’: Censorship in Occupied Japan</h5>

<p>On the other hand, <em>Tokyoberg</em> worked to erase (or, worse, instrumentalise) the atomic bombings Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Until the United States ceased the Japanese occupation in 1952, no photographs or videos portraying the damage caused to civilians were released.</p>

<p>One of the earliest accounts on selectivity applied in international criminal justice belongs to Justice Pal in his famous dissent at Tokyo. He was outraged by the concept of trying leaders for crimes of which the prosecutors were themselves guilty: the decision of the American government to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was, in his assessment, a clear example of a crime against humanity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> Cryer praises Pal’s exposition for identifying this primeval bias in international criminal justice,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> which contrasted with the widespread notion that <em>Tokyoberg</em> should be regarded as the beginning of a new era of accountability, a milestone in the fight against the impunity of those who shock the conscience of humankind.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> In addition, Justice Pal stated: ‘his decision to use the atom bomb is the only near approach to the directives of the German emperor during the first world war and of the Nazi leaders during the second world war. Nothing like this could be traced to the credit of the accused.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> Pal’s dissenting opinion was not read at the trial and it was not published in Japan after the American occupation was finished.</p>

<p>The use of atomic weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not awaken what some hoped would ‘bring about a unity of humanity, linked to all our fellow human beings, irrespective of race, creed, or color, by bonds which have been fused unbreakably in the diabolical heat of these explosions’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> In the end, Justice Pal concluded, there was no justification for these inhuman blasts.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> In the same vein, one of the Japanese members of the defence counsel, Okamoto Shoichi,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> strived to bring justice to the victims of the bombings: he was convinced that indiscriminate attacks on civilians with atomic bombs clearly constituted war crimes that should not have gone unnoticed in the Tokyo Trial.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a></p>

<p>However, the lack of consideration of the atrociousness of the atomic bombings at the trial received surprisingly meagre commentaries outside of Pal’s and Shoichi’s. As Polunina highlights, even the Soviets – who had complained about many failures of the proceedings – remained remarkably reserved about Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the trial and in their home press.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a></p>

<p>The United States carefully engineered a strict censorship mechanism which was in force during most times of the American occupation, and even when there were brief periods of press freedom, reporting on atomic damage was basically done through eyewitness accounts and scarce scientific evidence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> A special unit was created: the ‘Publications, Pictorial and Broadcast Section’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> It issued a ‘Manual on Censorship in Japan’ directed to the censors, in which they were told that their primary mission was to ensure that the efforts of Japan to emerge from its defeat as a new nation, entitled to a place among the peace-loving nations of the world, would not be harmed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> In January 1946, the motion picture industry in Japan was informed that no film could be shown without prior clearance by the censors, including simple paper movies shown by itinerant storytellers.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> Even those who owned films had to make detailed reports of them.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Alongside the endeavours to conceal the horrifying effects of the bombings, the manipulation of photographs and videos was intended to portray an image of Japan’s war guilt, both inside Japan and to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Even prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, imagery had been utilised for the stigmatisation of the Japanese regime within the Western collective imagination. When the Japanese army attacked Shanghai in the summer of 1937, the photographer H. S. Wong, working for an American agency, captured the image of a Chinese baby covered in blood, crying desperately, surrounded by destroyed railway tracks. Wong would later recall that the baby’s mother lay dead some meters away from him.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> The picture, titled ‘Bloody Saturday’, was sent to New York and featured in Hearst newsreels, newspapers and life magazine—the widest audience a picture could then have.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> Viewed by more than 136 million people, it struck a personal chord that transcended ethnicity and geography: to many, the infant’s pain represented Japan’s bloodlust.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> The photograph is now included in TIME’s magazine ‘Most Influential Images of All Time’.</p>

<p>TIME’s collection contains, as well, a depiction of the drop of the atomic bomb. When the 20-kiloton weapon hit Nagasaki, approximately 80 thousand people died instantly. However, the iconic photograph shows no humans, but a massive cloud of radioactive debris, as it was taken by Lieutenant Charles Levy from the US observation aircraft named, paradoxically, ‘The Great Artiste’. According to TIME, ‘Officials censored photos of the bomb’s devastation, but Levy’s image … was circulated widely. The effect shaped American opinion in favor of the nuclear bomb, leading the nation to celebrate the atomic age.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> The sanitised depersonalisation of the bombings was rigorously devised and presented as nothing but military progress against the bellicose enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the quote by Benjamin Wright, a historian at UT Texas who recently contributed to curate a book containing Japanese photographs of the bombed cities and populations, can illustrate a sentiment that still lingers: ‘Americans, when they think about atomic war, think about the mushroom cloud.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a></p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Kendall and Nouwen argue that international criminal justice operates in the representation of victims in two ways: through their participation in trials, and through the discursive invocation of abstract victimhood.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> The latter, which transcends all actual victims and corresponds to no individual victims in their particularity, becomes a figure of victimhood that is deployed as a kind of new sovereign of international criminal law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> The aesthetics of this victimhood, coming back to the notion of spectacle in international criminal law, are presented to the audience in the most colourful and dramatic way possible.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a></p>

<p>The narratives around <em>Tokyoberg </em>were constructed to invoke the sentiments of the international community towards the pressing need to punish those who had outraged the conscience of humankind. In that effort, a massive display of imagery was presented to the different audiences around the world, which were juridically and sensorially summoned to integrate the morality of international law and claim for justice. For this purpose, the vivid construction of victimhood was paramount.</p>

<p>However, <em>Tokyoberg</em> also represents the dialectic dyad of victimhood versus <em>victimlessness</em>. These two contrasting concepts encompassed the building of a conscience of humankind that was carefully produced and discursively engineered to consolidate a juridical humanity 75 years ago. In the prevailing discourse, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atrocities were sterilised: they became the mushroom clouds, the deserved response to a war-guilty nation, the effort to bring war to an end. Unseen were the images of humans suffering, and intact remained the assembled conscience of humankind. The <em>hibakusha</em> victimhood belongs to the ‘missing scenes’ of the <em>Tokyoberg</em> movie. In its place: the dehumanised victimlessness.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline62" href="#62">62</a></p>

	     <h4 id="abstract">Abstract:</h4>

<p>This article analyses the European Court of Human Rights’ use of the concepts of ‘European consensus’ and ‘margin of appreciation’ in light of their effects on minority rights. Normative justifications and objections to the Court’s use of the doctrines are outlined. Through an exploration of the Court’s jurisprudence on minority rights within the European Convention on Human Rights framework, the article illustrates that the Court’s opaque approach to its use of the doctrines can lead to a dilution of the protection of minority rights. The article concludes that it will thus be crucial for the Court to provide safeguards for any future use of these interpretive tools in cases where minority rights are at stake.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>This article embarks on a critical discussion of the European Court of Human Rights’ (“ECtHR”) use of European consensus (“EuC”) and the margin of appreciation (“MoA”) in light of its effect on minority rights. The two concepts are firstly defined and situated in context. Thereafter, normative justifications and objections to the use of EuC in determining the width of the MoA are outlined. The article does not provide a thorough review of the Court’s general case law on minority rights. Rather, it highlights a lack of clarity in the Court’s application of EuC and MoA and the consequences flowing from this. This is illustrated through a line of cases regarding the rights of transgender persons, Roma children and Muslim women. The article concludes that while there is some value in the ECtHR’s current approach, it will nonetheless be important for the Court to develop a consistent and rigorous methodology for the application of the doctrines in cases regarding minority rights. This is crucial for the Court to maintain its role as guardian of the European human rights regime.</p>

<h4 id="the-contours-of-the-interpretive-tools">The Contours of the Interpretive Tools</h4>

<p>The MoA refers to “the room for manoeuvre Strasbourg institutions are prepared to accord national authorities in fulfilling their obligations” under the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a>  The EuC refers to “the level of uniformity present in the legal frameworks of the member States of the Council of Europe on a particular topic”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a>  The Court uses EuC to justify a wide MoA afforded to Member States in the absence of consensus, and advance new standards where there is a clear trend present across Member States.</p>

<p>The tools are mostly used at the third stage of review of qualified rights – following the first two stages, which require any interference with qualified rights to be prescribed by law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. A key question at the third stage is the degree of deference the Court ought to afford states in determining whether a particular interference with a right is necessary in a democratic society to protect the legitimate aims listed in the ECHR. In general, where there is a lack of an EuC, the Court will afford a broader MoA to Member States, and vice versa. Further, the scope of the MoA afforded directly relates to the strictness of review: the wider the margin, the less strict the scrutiny by the Court, and vice versa.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a>  Thus, the existence of an EuC is the determining factor for the Court when defining the scope of the MoA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<h4 id="the-normative-foundation">The Normative Foundation</h4>

<p>The question to be addressed at the outset is whether the Court’s use of an EuC to determine the width of the MoA can be normatively justified. A central role of the ECtHR is to correct injustices perpetrated by the majority against minorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a>  Indeed, the Court has declared that part of its mandate is to protect individuals from infringements of Convention rights “grounded upon a predisposed bias on the part of a […] majority against a […] minority”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a>  This invites the question of which interpretive tools are appropriate to employ in fulfilling this mandate. In evaluating whether EuC is an appropriate tool, two competing elements are emphasised: firstly, the importance of the expansion of the protection traditionally afforded under a Convention right by the Court to vulnerable minority groups, and secondly, the recognition that the impact of such a progressive interpretation is grounded in the Court’s legitimacy vis-à-vis Member States.</p>

<p>Objections to EuC stem from the Court’s mandate of safeguarding minority rights. Minorities are often barred from equal participation in the democratic process domestically – it is therefore important for the ECtHR to serve as a “countermajoritarian check”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Critics have highlighted the inherent contradiction in the ECtHR resorting to a quantitative exercise in determining the EuC, particularly where the applicant belongs to a minority group.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> In light of the Court’s mandate, reliance on EuC seems “counterintuitive, if not problematic, when determining the rights of unpopular social groups and minorities”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>The Court must exercise caution in applying the doctrines in the context of minority rights. Lodging a complaint to the ECtHR can be the only recourse to justice a minority has when the rights of its members are not protected domestically. Indeed, affording states a wide MoA on the basis of a lack of a uniform approach might deprive a minority of human rights protection, since the institution established to promote their rights will be relying on the same majoritarian bias that the group is seeking to reverse. For groups that have experienced widespread, systemic abuses of their rights, the EuC seems to be a counterproductive tool to determine their rights.</p>

<p>In defence of the doctrine, it is argued that the use of EuC is justified, as it aids the Court in preserving its legitimacy. The Court operates under the principle of subsidiarity, which “determines its role as secondary to […] national legal orders […] that have the primary responsibility of implementing and interpreting the Convention”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> A state in disagreement of a judgment can, in principle, choose not to renew the right of individual petition, withdraw from the Convention, or express its discontent through failing to or delaying its compliance with a judgment. The Court is faced with a difficult task: it must reverse rights-abusive practices of Contracting States whilst preserving its legitimacy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> With the surge of criticism that the Court “has frequently exceeded its mandate”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> consensus-based interpretation can provide a means to legitimise the Court’s judgments and ensure their enforcement.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> For the Court to guard the European human rights regime, its legitimacy must be preserved. Otherwise, the Court’s decisions will have a limited practical effect within domestic legal systems and the substantive protection of human rights will effectively be removed.</p>

<p>Finally, the use of EuC in determining the scope of the MoA has been justified on the basis that the Court can rely on the doctrines to interpret the Convention progressively and strengthen minority rights. As contended by Tzevelekos and Dzehtsiarou, when minority rights are at stake in a given case, the Court has a compelling justification to use the tools with greater flexibility and enhance the protection of minority rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Such an approach can render the tools normatively compatible with the two competing accounts on the role of EuC in minority rights cases. However, as it is more likely that a consensus exists against a minority when examining minority rights under the lens of EuC, the danger exists that the Court’s application of the tools can stifle minority rights. It is therefore pertinent that the Court adopts this approach – namely, relying on the doctrines to strengthen minority rights – uniformly across cases concerning minority groups.</p>

<h4 id="the-courts-approach-opaque-or-clear">The Court’s Approach: Opaque or Clear?</h4>

<p>To illustrate the Court’s approach to EuC and MoA, the article focuses on application of the doctrines in cases concerning three minority groups where the Court has adopted substantively different approaches: the rights of transgender persons, Roma children, and Muslim women.</p>

<p>The Court’s opaque approach can be illustrated in a line of cases concerning the rights of transgender persons. The line begins with <em>Rees,</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> regarding the legal recognition of the sexual identity of post-operative transsexual individuals. The Court found that an EuC was not present, as there was “little common ground between the Contracting States in this area and that […] the law appear[ed] to be in a transitional state”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Consequently, the Court afforded the state a wide MoA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> The Court recognised the severity of the consequences caused by a lack of legal recognition of this group of persons’ identity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a>Despite this, the Court held that the lack of an EuC outweighed the interest in applying strict review of the State’s infringement of their rights under Article 8. The Court, however, warned states to keep this area of the law “under review”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> and adapt their legislation accordingly.</p>

<p>In the cases of <em>Cossey</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> and <em>Sheffield</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> the Court reaffirmed its position in <em>Rees.</em> The majority found that developments in the legislation of Member States was not enough for the Court to determine that an EuC was now present.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> While this was in line with its reasoning in <em>Rees</em>, the Court failed to signal what specifically within the field the states ought to keep under review to update legislation in line with the Convention. The dissenting opinion of Judge Martiens reveals a disagreement between the judges on this point. Judge Martiens found that the existence of an EuC on the matter was strongly reinforced by the increased consensus from five to fourteen Contracting States, along with supporting resolutions by “the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament recommending that reclassification of the sex of a post-operative transsexual be made legally possible”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The disagreement between judges highlights the lack of a clear set of criteria for the determination of EuC. This lack of clarity resulted in the Court widening the MoA and refraining from applying strict review to strengthen this category of persons’ rights.</p>

<p>The turning point in the case law was <em>Goodwin</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> where the Court officially narrowed the MoA for Member States on the legal recognition of the sexual identity of post-operative transsexual individuals. The determining factor was, once again, EuC. The Court found that there was still a lack of “a common European approach”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> Despite this being the main factor preventing the Court from taking a step forward in the protection of transgender rights in the aforementioned cases, the Court turned its approach on its head. The Court attached “less importance to the lack of” an EuC “than to the clear and uncontested evidence of a continuing international trend in favour not only of increased social acceptance of transsexuals but of legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> It is clear that the Court has neither developed, nor is bound by, any strict criteria in applying the doctrines.</p>

<p>The breakthrough of the <em>Goodwin</em> judgement does not mark the end of the saga. As confirmed in <em>Goodwin</em>: while the Court found that EuC existed regarding the legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals, the Court did not find that EuC was present regarding states’ determination of the conditions to such recognition.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Requirements set out by states for legal recognition varied and most of these criteria were criticised, including for undermining individual autonomy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> In <em>A.P., Garçon</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> the Court examined the compatibility of the ECHR requirements for gender recognition of an “irreversible change in appearance”, interpreted as compulsory sterilisation,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> and the mandatory diagnosis of “gender identity disorder”. The Court found that a common approach was not present on the subject, as states were divided regarding the sterility requirement.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> Nevertheless, the Court relied on a trend emerging in recent years towards abolishing the condition.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> Despite the lack of a strong EuC on the subject, the Court found the trend to be a sufficient basis on which to narrow the MoA. The Court therefore employed strict review of the applicant’s rights and ruled that the compulsory sterilisation requirement violated the applicants’ Article 8 rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a></p>

<p>As mandatory sex reassignment surgery interferes with physical integrity to a similar extent as forced sterilisation, a logical next step in this evolution would have been to find such a requirement to violate Article 8 in the case of <em>X v FYROM</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> The requirement of mandatory sex reassignment bars transgender, genderfluid, non-binary and other  genderqueer persons who choose not to or are unable to undergo sex reassignment surgery from gender recognition. In their dissenting opinion, judges Pejchal and Wojtyczek criticised the judgement of <em>Garçon</em> for finding that a ‘trend’ was sufficient to narrow the MoA. They argued that such an analysis was a typical sign of “judicial activism”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Because of the disagreements within the Court on the proper application of EuC, the Court “refused to examine the applicant’s claim that mandatory sex reassignment surgery as a requirement for gender recognition […] violated Article 8”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a></p>

<p>The Court in <em>Goodwin</em> identified three hallmarks of proper decision-making, all vital to uphold the rule of law: “legal certainty, foreseeability and equality”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Ironically, the Court’s approach to the application of the doctrines violates all three. Throughout the ECtHR’s jurisprudence on transgender rights, the Court has failed to sufficiently determine the scope and proper application of EuC despite the vital role this tool has played. Lack of legal certainty and foreseeability flows from this. Disagreements about EuC resulted in “the Court’s reluctance to directly address pathologizing conditions for legal gender recognition”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> thus aggravating existing vulnerabilities of this minority group.</p>

<h4 id="the-courts-opaque-approach-strengthening-or-diluting-minority-rights">The Court’s Opaque Approach: Strengthening or Diluting Minority Rights?</h4>

<p>Does the Court’s opaque approach to EuC undermine or reinforce the Court’s ability to enforce the protection of minority rights? Philosophers from Aristotle to Hart have recognized that all systems of law must negotiate a fundamental tension between legal certainty and flexibility.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> The Court’s lack of a clear methodology in its application of EuC has enabled the Court to employ the doctrine with full flexibility.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> Dzehtsiarou argues that the Court is aware of the limitations to their use of the doctrine, and that where minority rights are at stake, the Court has convincing justification to use the tool with greater flexibility or lessen the weight placed on it.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> Flexibility can allow the Court to take progressive steps for minority rights, even in situations where an EuC is not conclusively present.</p>

<p>The flexibility of the doctrines has indeed enabled the Court to rely on EuC to determine the applicants’ minority status to narrow the MoA of states and consequently enhance their protection under the Convention. This can be illustrated through the case of <em>Oršuš.</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> The application concerned Roma children’s right to education.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> Roma children were placed in separate classes in Croatia on account of their lack of proficiency in Croatian language. The Courtnoted an emerging consensus amongst Member States recognising the “special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> The Court relied on EuC to determine the status of the applicants as members of a minority group. This enabled the Court to narrow the MoA and exercise intense scrutiny of the measure. The flexibility of the tool allowed “the Court space for manoeuvre”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> in its application of EuC, and to strengthen the rights of a vulnerable minority group.</p>

<p>However, the lack of a clear approach in the application of EuC in cases regarding minority rights has stripped the Court of the necessary constraints in its application of the doctrines in this realm. As illustrated by the case of <em>SAS</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> EuC has been used to the detriment of minority rights without sufficient justification. The case concerned a French blanket ban prohibiting the covering of one’s face in public. The Court recognised that the measure interfered with the rights of a minority group, namely “Muslim women who choose to manifest their religion through wearing religious attire”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> The Court noted that, “from a strictly normative standpoint”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> France was in a minority position in Europe as few Member States had imposed such a blanket ban. However, the Court found that because such a blanket ban had been the subject of debate in some Member States, which was proof of a lack of an EuC against the ban,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> and France was afforded a wide MoA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> As noted by the dissenting opinion, “it is difficult to understand why the majority [were] not prepared to accept the existence” of an EuC against the ban,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> when “an overwhelming majority, [had] not deemed it necessary to legislate in this area”, and thus “a very strong indicator for a European consensus” against the ban existed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a>In contrast to its reasoning in the <em>Oršuš</em> case, the Court did not rely on the EuC to invite closer scrutiny in light of the applicant’s minority status. Rather, the determination of EuC formed part of the foundation on which the Court held that the ban was proportionate to the aim pursued, rendering it necessary in a democratic society, and thus that the interference with this minority group’s rights was justified.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> It is clear that the danger exists that the flexibility of the tool can weaken the Court’s ability to protect minority groups from discriminatory, majoritarian measures of Member States.</p>

<h4 id="safeguards-for-the-future-of-the-european-human-rights-regime">Safeguards for the Future of the European Human Rights Regime</h4>

<p>The Brighton Declaration,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> today reflected in the 2018 Copenhagen Declaration <a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> and Protocol 15, which enshrines subsidiarity and the MoA in the preamble of the ECHR, signals that the “centre of gravity of the Convention system” will “be lower than it is today, closer temporally and spatially to all Europeans”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> It is clear that EuC and the MoA will play a vital role for the future of the ECtHR in shifting the focus to a “shared responsibility”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> It is therefore important to provide safeguards to the future use of these tools.</p>

<p>Against a backdrop of the rising threats of climate change, nuclear weapons and the COVID-19 pandemic, one does not have to imagine a consensus or trend developing in Europe where personal liberties are restricted in the interests of national security or public safety and health. It is therefore crucial that the advancement of minority rights in the Court’s jurisprudence is not “inextricably linked to majoritarian consent expressed through EuC” and that infringements of rights are rigorously scrutinised by the Court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> The failure to articulate with precision the scope and function of EuC poses a potentially grave threat to the ECtHR’s role as the arbiter of European human rights, particularly of minorities.</p>

<p>The time has come to develop a consistent and rigorous methodology for the application of EuC in cases regarding minority rights. If the Court accepts the need to narrow the MoA where minority rights are involved, a clearer test must be developed of the appropriate relationship between EuC and minority protection. This will ensure a consistent approach across cases regarding the rights of minority groups. Alternatively, where the Court departs from this approach, it must provide convincing analysis in its reasoning for the necessity of this. The Court must strive to develop clear, general principles for weighing the competing elements of the EuC and the MoA doctrines in cases where minority rights are at stake. Such safeguards must be in place to ensure that EuC is applied with careful consideration of minority rights across the Court’s jurisprudence.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The string of cases regarding transgender rights is glaring proof of the Court’s opaque approach in applying the doctrines of EuC and MoA, underlined by the ongoing disagreement within the Court and the lack of constraint which the Court’s application of EuC in earlier cases proved to have on its approach in subsequent cases. This approach has enabled the Court to take progressive steps in the fight for minority rights, as illustrated by the cases of <em>Goodwin, Garçon</em> and <em>Oršuš.</em> However, the Court’s approach has also resulted in a dilution of minority rights, as illustrated in the cases of <em>SAS</em> and <em>X v FYROM</em>. The article recognises that the Court’s approach has enabled it to mitigate disagreements within the Court and navigate the tension between operating under the principle of subsidiarity and the role it has reserved for itself in securing the rights of marginalised groups. However, it is concluded that the Court must develop a clearer methodology to underpin its use of the doctrines in order to ensure that minority rights are strengthened rather than diluted. The appropriate application of the doctrines in cases regarding minority rights must be clearly defined and consistently adopted across the Court’s jurisprudence. Transparency, legal certainty and equity – key facets of the Court’s process legitimacy – are safeguards that must be kept in place. Only then can judges of the ECtHR “hold firm the compass of morality, guiding the communal ship towards more enlightened standards, [whilst] taking into account the prevailing winds and sea conditions”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> and reinforce its crucial role in securing minority rights protection across Europe.</p>

	     <h4 id="abstract">Abstract:</h4>

<p><em>Investor-State Dispute Settlement is currently facing a legitimacy crisis which threatens to rattle the very foundations of the system. It is suggested this crisis can be divided in two: a procedural crisis, which can be addressed by reform, and a substantive crisis, which threatens the existence of the entire regime. This article focuses on the deeper substantive crisis caused by the problem of reverse discrimination. Specifically, it engages with constitutional terms of analysis to address the way in which reverse discrimination undermines national constitutional stability. It analyses exactly why the affront to constitutional stability is currently becoming particularly hard to bear for nation states. The conclusion is that the substantive legitimacy crisis faced by investment treaty law can only be addressed by a comprehensive repeal of the system.</em></p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>The EU has failed to reach an agreement with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in large part because of its Investment Chapter: neither party could accept that foreign investors would be subject to a different set of rights than domestic companies.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> It is patently clear that the legitimacy of Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) is currently under threat.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> The first point is that the ISDS system currently faces two separate, but related, legitimacy crises. The first crisis, of procedural legitimacy, is strictly internal to the system – it stems from issues related to the way in which ISDS is dispensed. Importantly, these issues can be addressed by reform without significantly overhauling the system. The second, substantive legitimacy crisis, is exogenous to the workings of the system – it is rooted in the very logic of investment treaty law. The focus of this article is on this second, existential, challenge to the system. An insight will be provided into the issue of ‘reverse discrimination’, a practice through which foreign investors are able to use bilateral investment treaties (BITs) to obtain a different treatment than national companies. The existing literature on this topic describes the problems created by reverse discrimination in rather broad terms: reverse discrimination is accused of generally ‘undermining democratic accountability’ and ‘threatening legitimacy’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> The central purpose of the present article is to couch the issue of reverse discrimination in much more specific constitutional terms. As such, we will argue why the very logic of investment treaty law compromises constitutional commitments on the national level. We will also analyse why exactly this birth defect is now emerging as particularly unpalatable for sovereign states. This will lead to the unassailable conclusion that abandoning the ISDS system is necessary in order to protect national constitutional stability. </p>

<h4 id="1--explaining-the-two-aspects-of-the-legitimacy-crisis">1.  Explaining the two aspects of the legitimacy crisis</h4>

<p>It is widely understood that the ISDS system is currently plunged in a profound legitimacy crisis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has formerly recognized this in asserting the pressing need for reform.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> Its most recent Working Paper (2020) identified three proposals: (i) the potential introduction of a ‘stand-alone review or appellate mechanism’; (ii)  the creation of a ‘multilateral investment court’; and (iii) a fairer ‘selection and appointment of arbitrators and adjudicators’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> These proposals recognise that ISDS is undergoing a procedural legitimacy crisis, one which is strictly internal to the system. Their aim is therefore to reform ISDS from the inside. Importantly, the UNCITRAL diagnoses a strictly procedural crisis: they do not call for integral repeal of the system, but rather, seek to reform a number of its procedures. </p>

<p>Kelsey et al. note that a narrow focus on procedural issues carries the risk of ignoring the substantive challenges to the system – i.e. those which pose an existential threat to ISDS.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> To a certain extent, it is not a surprise that UNCITRAL refuses to address substantive critiques of the system. Indeed, it is uniquely set up to look at the system from an internal perspective. The Guide to UNCITRAL published by the UNCITRAL secretariat states that part of the Commission’s mandate is to promote ’wider participation in existing international conventions and wider acceptance of existing model and uniform laws’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> As a reform body, it is engineered to consider only issues of procedure, without ever challenging the logic of ISDS itself. </p>

<p>Our contention is that a wider substantive legitimacy crisis dwarfs the narrow procedural crisis addressed by UNCITRAL. Specifically, the issue of reverse discrimination threatens to shake the constitutional foundations of sovereign states. The remainder of this article focuses on this broader, existential challenge, and explores why the system must therefore be overturned.</p>

<h4 id="2--the-substantive-aspect-of-the-legitimacy-crisis-how-reverse-discrimination-threatens-constitutional-stability">2.  The substantive aspect of the legitimacy crisis: how reverse discrimination threatens constitutional stability</h4>

<h5 id="a-how-does-isds-entail-reverse-discrimination"><strong>a) How does ISDS entail reverse discrimination?</strong></h5>

<p>Originally, the vast majority of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) were signed between a developed, capital-exporting country and a developing, capital-importing country.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> As Jandhyala et. al note, during the first wave of BIT signings, ’the adoption of a BIT helped reassure foreign investors by offsetting weak and unstable domestic institutions in host countries.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Foreign investors would be encouraged to invest in developing countries, emboldened by the certainty that their investment would not be subjected to host country legal institutions, and therefore not expropriated or confiscated.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> BITs were thus a way to hedge against political risk through law. Legally, these treaties were always reciprocal, but investment flows almost never came towards the developed country, which meant that policies in developed countries were very rarely challenged in investment arbitrations. As Mann demonstrates, the bilateral dimension of BITs was initially included only as a ceremonial recognition of the developing country’s sovereignty – in this sense, reciprocity was ’a matter of prestige [rather] than reality’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> This changed when Free Trade Agreements including investment chapters (such as NAFTA and the Energy Charter Treaty<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> were concluded between countries with equally strong commitments to democracy and the rule of law. Suddenly, it became evident that foreign investors could challenge national policies in democratic states. Specifically, this entails that a foreign investor is not subject to the same regime as a national investor: where a national investor has no choice but to abide by national regulations, a foreign investor is able to challenge certain measures as per the terms of the BIT. This epitomises the problem of ‘reverse discrimination’ which exists in favour of foreign investors. </p>

<h5 id="b-reverse-discrimination--the-threat-to-constitutional-stability"><strong>b) Reverse discrimination – the threat to constitutional stability</strong></h5>

<p>Much of the existing literature describes the problems raised by reverse discrimination in rather broad terms: reverse discrimination is accused of generally ‘undermining democratic accountability,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> ’unduly limiting the policy space of signatory governments<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> and ‘threatening legitimacy’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> The purpose of the present article is to frame the issue of reverse discrimination in much more specific constitutional terms. In doing so, we will reach a clearer understanding of why ISDS, and more specifically reverse discrimination, poses an affront to constitutional stability. </p>

<h5 id="i-the-framework-of-analysis"><em><u>(i) The framework of analysis</u></em></h5>

<p>As Halberstam sets out, a nation state is a social artefact – its inherent purpose is to further the needs and aspirations of its constituents.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> From this premise, Dawson and De Witte have concluded that a polity is ’only stable and legitimate, then, if it structurally incorporates and reflects the values that ”matter” to its constituents’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Accordingly, durable legitimacy requires a dual commitment to ‘self-determination’. The first commitment is to ‘political self-determination’: it requires having an institutional mechanism which mediates between competing visions within the polity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> This process, which invites all contrasting views to come together in deciding on policy outcomes, enables these very outcomes to be shrouded in a certain legitimacy. The second commitment is to ensure that, from a legal perspective, legal actors are free and equal.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a></p>

<p>We propose to assess ISDS in light of this theoretical framework set out by Dawson and De Witte. We hope to demonstrate the extent to which the very logic of the system, which brings about reverse discrimination, undermines the two central tenets of stability and legitimacy in a nation state. Therein, we contend, lies the real reason for the ISDS system’s legitimacy crisis. </p>

<h5 id="ii-how-does-reverse-discrimination-undermine-states-political-ownership-over-laws-and-regulations"><em><u>(ii) How does reverse discrimination undermine states' political ownership over laws and regulations?</u></em></h5>

<p>Through the problem of reverse discrimination, ISDS both challenges and undermines states’ ability to decide upon their own rules and regulations. This is epitomised, firstly, by the fact that certain ISDS proceedings result in states having to pay out of public funds for democratically reached policy choices. Kelsey et al. note that this is perceived as particularly problematic when pay-outs are destined to large transnational corporations and redirected away from spending on education and healthcare.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> In many situations, this problem is amplified by the lack of transparency that covers many investment arbitrations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>A number of states have voiced their concerns on this very matter. The South African Government, in their proposal to the UNCITRAL, highlighted that the ISDS system creates a framework where ’the investors’ property and contractual rights supersede public interest and public needs’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> Specifically, they raised the point that the system is ’detrimental to public budgets, regulations in the public interest, democracy and the rule of law’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Similar concerns have also been echoed by Brazil and Indonesia before the UNCITRAL.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a></p>

<p>The paradigm example of this problem was demonstrated by the <em>Vattenfall</em> ICSID decision, where a Swedish company, having invested in nuclear energy in Germany, was successful in obtaining compensation for Germany’s political decision to exit from nuclear energy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Against the backdrop of the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (Japan), Germany reached a broad consensus to amend the Atomic Energy Act,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> and thereby abandon the use of nuclear energy by 2022.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> In conjunction with this amendment, seven further legislative proposals from the federal government were adopted, aiming to bring about a new era of energy policy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Germany’s decision was clearly the outcome of a concerted process. The ISDS system thus seems to make countries pay for reasonable democratic choices.  This case caused specific backlash in German society because <em>Vattenfall</em> was able to circumvent three levels of jurisdiction: national, EU and ECHR, two of which Germany shared with Sweden.   </p>

<p>Secondly, the very prospect of being challenged before an investment tribunal has chilling effects on sovereign states’ ability to exercise their authority, an effect which goes beyond the fiscal cost of defending disputes. Indeed, the investment regime, by enabling foreign companies to challenge national measures before an investment tribunal, causes chilling effects both directly (when the threat of investment dispute deters government action) and indirectly (when a country may decide to refrain from adopting a specific measure because it is already involved in numerous disputes).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> This may lead to a ‘systemic’ chill where policy-making incorporates an assessment of the potential risks of an investment dispute.  </p>

<p>One may counter the preceding argument by highlighting that sovereign states are not coerced into entering BITs. As such, being bound by BITs would equally be an expression of national political will, and undermining these international agreements would also amount to thwarting political ownership over decision-making.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> This argument would be defensible if sovereign states knew exactly the scope of the consequences derived from signing up to BITs. However, as noted above, where legal reciprocity was always a feature of BITs, the factual and economic reciprocity of investment flows has only emerged in recent years. </p>

<p>This is in part due to the economic emergence of developing economies which, in turn, started issuing foreign direct investments.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> The UNCTAD studied this issue, noting that where developing economies emitted 14% of the world’s share of FDI in the world in 1995, they represented 21% of the world share in 2009,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> a trend that has since continued to rise. In 2014, developing and transitioning economies accounted for 38% of the world share in FDI.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> A significant portion of this FDI is in fact directed towards developed economies. </p>

<p>In correlation to this increase, developing countries have appeared with increasing frequency before ISDS tribunals in investment disputes. Whereas in 2012 only 11% of claimants hailed from developing or transition economies,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> the number has increasingly surged, amounting to 32% in 2018.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> Importantly, many of these cases have been brought against developed economies. In an era where Portugal has actively encouraged investment from Angola into its public utilities sector,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> the prospect of developed states defending their policies before investment tribunals has become increasingly likely. </p>

<p>But the emergence of legal reciprocity in investment flows is also attributable to developed states inadvertently agreeing upon investment chapters among themselves. The case in point is the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT),<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> which was initially viewed as a multilateral treaty safeguarding EU investments in Eastern European states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> As Alvarez notes, after more than a decade the EU realised that the ECT could be used by EU companies to protect foreign investments in fellow member states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> This was particularly shocking as it amounted to circumventing the common EU level investment legislation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a></p>

<p>Historical contingency played a significant role in creating this rare occurrence in international law – by no means do sovereign states regularly commit such consequential errors when reaching international agreements. The Lisbon Treaty, concluded in 2009, provided that all intra-EU investment disputes would be submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> As such, it had the effect of terminating many pre-existing intra-EU BITs, given their incompatibility with EU law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> The Lisbon Treaty, however, was unable to terminate the ECT, which had entered into force in 1998, specifically because it was not a strictly intra-EU BIT. Indeed, the ECT is a binding international treaty that not only includes all of the EU Member States, but also a number of third states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> This seemingly anecdotal legal episode has since yielded tremendous consequences for the ISDS system. The UNCTAD estimates that the ECT was invoked in 20% of all investor-state arbitrations world-wide,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> making it the single most frequently invoked mechanism for ISDS.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> Of these ECT disputes to date, 64% were strictly intra-EU.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a></p>

<p>What this particular situation reveals is the extent to which states sometimes cannot anticipate the full ambit of international mechanisms to which they subscribe. In any case, it is manifest that the ISDS system, through reverse discrimination, challenges sovereign states’ political ownership over their laws and regulations. Therefore, the ISDS system undermines a core feature of stable constitutions.</p>

<h5 id="iii-how-does-reverse-discrimination-undermine-freedom-and-equality-amongst-actors"><u>(iii) How does reverse discrimination undermine freedom and equality amongst actors?</u></h5>

<p>As Jan Kleinheisterkamp argues, ISDS grants greater rights to foreign investors than to national investors: this undermines states’ democratic commitment to equality of rights, and means that domestic companies do not have the same freedom to act as their domestic counterparts.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> The ‘greater rights’ granted to foreign investors manifest themselves in several ways: (i) they allow the foreign investor to explore an avenue for redress which the national investor cannot explore, (ii) they enable foreign investors to claim limitless awards by circumventing the limits that operate on compensation in domestic courts and (iii) they also enable foreign investors to enter into contracts with states without facing the same political risk that a national company would face. Kelsey et al. note that this inequality of rights amongst economic actors significantly distorts market relations in favour of foreign companies: having the ISDS outlet means that the amount of risk incorporated in their investment decisions is largely inferior compared to their domestic counterparts.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a></p>

<p>In an attempt to counter this observation, Christian Riffel, amongst others, posits that ISDS does not undermine states’ commitments to equality before the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> Two broad types of arguments are made to this end. </p>

<h6 id="the-first-line-of-counter-argument"><u>The first line of counter-argument</u></h6>

<p>The first line of argument suggests that applying the same rules to national and foreign investors is not desirable since they are in materially different positions to start off with.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> It therefore sees carving out a specific regime for foreign investors as a way of balancing out the starting positions. An example of this initial difference is the specific due diligence imposed on foreign companies by acts such as the Enterprise Act,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> when entering the UK market.</p>

<p>The investment protection system seeks to eliminate this initial difference by implementing standards in international investment treaties which are ’functionally comparable to constitutional guarantees and administrative law principles at the domestic level’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Kleinheisterkamp refers to this as following a ‘logic of substitution’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> Foreign investors are not subjected to national judicial procedures which may discriminate against them unfairly – rather, the national procedures are ‘substituted’ by an international procedure which emulates the way national procedures would work for domestic companies. This artificial mechanism thereby intends to cut all discrimination out of the process. </p>

<p>In practice, however, carving out a separate regime for foreign investors does not necessarily have the desired effect of replicating national procedures. One reason for this points to the multitude of different national procedures, and the impossibility for the international regime to reflect all of these accurately. Indeed, each domestic jurisdiction strikes its own subtle balance between ‘the private interests of investors and the public interests of host states.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> The provisions encapsulated in BITs are unable to reflect these specific balances because they frame standards of protection in general and open-textured language. It is almost a trite fact that standards of judicial review such as ‘fair and equitable treatment’, ‘full protection and security’ and ‘indirect expropriation’ are highly vague and can be given different content depending on the case at hand, and the panel hearing it. In the Suez case, the UNCITRAL reflected this point by highlighting that the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard can only be defined by terms of ‘almost equal vagueness’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> This mismatch between ‘general’ standards in BITs and ‘specific’ balances on the national level reveals the practical impossibility for investment treaty law to satisfy the ‘logic of substitution’ that forms its guiding principle. </p>

<p>A second related reason why carving out a separate regime for foreign investors through BITs does not effectively replicate national procedures is that at times, investment treaty law creates more favourable conditions for foreign investors than would be available under national law for domestic companies. This problem of ‘reverse discrimination’ is a direct consequence of the aforementioned vagueness of BIT standards, and of the important discretion that investment tribunals have in ascribing content to these provisions. Because of this latitude, individual tribunals can confer awards to foreign investors where equivalent awards would not be available to domestic companies appearing before national courts.  The case in point is <em>Vattenfall</em>:<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> had Vattenfall been a domestic company, it would plainly have not been able to recoup its investment. Importantly, the decision in <em>Vattenfall</em> does not represent a one-off anomaly but falls within a broader trend. A couple of salient examples are the cases of <em>Masdar v. Spain<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a></em> and <em>Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a></em>, which replicate the <em>Vattenfall</em> format, enabling foreign investors to benefit from ISDS in a way which was unavailable to domestic companies.</p>

<p>This is not to say that investment treaty law systematically creates inverse discrimination in favour of foreign investors – in many occasions, international investment tribunals are able to track national procedures. In this sense, Lowe is not exactly right when he asserts that ’the consequence is plain and inescapable. BITs give foreign investors wider rights than nationals possess’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> Rather, BITs create the <em>potential</em> for foreign investors to have wider rights than nationals possess. However, what matters for the purposes of our analysis is that this potential exists – and that this potential sometimes comes to fruition. Indeed, what this demonstrates is that the separate regime for foreign investors does not, and cannot, successfully and systematically replicate national procedures. The potential for reverse discrimination inherent to investment treaty law therefore means that it does not, as Riffel suggests, successfully correct the initial imbalance between national and foreign investors. Their unequal position in front of the law is maintained.</p>

<p>Moreover, this line of argument which supports the separate system of investment treaty law for foreign investors is also flawed because it does not account for the idea that a company’s choice to enter a foreign market carries an inherent responsibility to adhere by domestic laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a> These are considerations that should be internalised by companies when they decide to make a foreign direct investment. </p>

<h6 id="the-second-line-of-counter-argument"><u>The second line of counter-argument</u></h6>

<p>The second line of argument posits that in practice, there is no material difference between the treatment of foreign companies under investment treaty law and that of domestic companies under domestic law, and therefore it would be erroneous to view investment treaty law as creating inequality.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline62" href="#62">62</a> The example given for this point is that ’domestic law may make available the same remedies as an international investment agreement’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline63" href="#63">63</a> Viewed alongside the first line of argument, it seems that supporters of ISDS are trying to have it both ways. Riffel stresses that investment treaty law both creates and doesn’t create inequality.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline64" href="#64">64</a> More importantly, as Kleinheisterkamp highlights, although in theory domestic remedies do exist, in practice the domestic paths to accessing such remedies are much more saturated than they are for investment tribunals.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline65" href="#65">65</a> As such, it would be plainly incorrect to assert that both investment tribunals and domestic courts lead to equal outcomes.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that ISDS, structured to create reverse discrimination, compromises national constitutional commitments to freedom and equality of all actors before the law. </p>

<h5 id="iv-constitutional-compromising-why-now"><u>(iv) Constitutional compromising: why now?</u></h5>

<p>What transpires from this analysis is that the very logic of investment treaty law, which carves out a different regime for foreign investors, undermines the central tenets of a stable and legitimate constitution within a polity: (i) political ownership over common rules and (ii) freedom and equality of all actors before the law. The ISDS’s substantive legitimacy crisis stems from its inherent incompatibility with the core constitutional values within states. </p>

<p>Yet, one may ponder why it is only now that the birth defects in the system are coming to the surface and creating a substantive legitimacy crisis. The first reason, detailed above, is that the legal reciprocity of BITs is only now accompanied by reciprocal investment flows. This is the case between developed and developing nations, but also between developing nations themselves.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline66" href="#66">66</a> This trend has been accelerated by recent cases, such as <em>Masdar v Spain</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline67" href="#67">67</a> where an increasingly broad interpretation of ‘investment’ has been adopted. Whereas ‘investment’ used to be reserved for significant transnational acquisitions of property, the term now seems vague enough to capture ordinary commercial transactions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline68" href="#68">68</a> Indeed, as Tim Samples demonstrates, economic and technological developments have changed the nature of investments, and therefore changed the definition of ‘investment’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline69" href="#69">69</a> Early generation BITs could not envisage, in their drafting, the current scope of investment treaty law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline70" href="#70">70</a></p>

<p>The second reason is that a number of landmark cases in the last few decades have shown that investment treaty law is being exploited by Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to avoid accountability in host states. One such case is <em>Methanex Corporation v. the United States</em> which raised this point in light of environmental rules.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline71" href="#71">71</a> In the late 1990s, a Canadian investor sued the United States because California had banned certain additives to car fuel for the protection of the environment. The idea that a foreign company could sue the United States because California was trying to protect its environment and public health caused a huge uproar in the United States – the matter was hotly debated by the House of Representatives.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline72" href="#72">72</a>  Although in this case the investment tribunal ruled in favour of the United States, it opened the floodgates to foreign investors challenging domestic laws in ISDS. A number of more recent cases have been won by investors challenging national environmental regulations,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline73" href="#73">73</a> but also challenging regulations in a host of other policy areas. These include cases on essential services,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline74" href="#74">74</a> financial stability,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline75" href="#75">75</a> and development and industrial policy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline76" href="#76">76</a> Such decisions have, in the past decade, increased attention on the investment treaty regime’s role in undermining national accountability. Doing so has revealed the substantive challenges to the system’s structural legitimacy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline77" href="#77">77</a>  </p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The ISDS system’s substantive legitimacy crisis is caused by the inherent logic of the system itself – for this reason, it simply cannot become legitimate. Threatening to increasingly undermine constitutional commitments at the national level, it is urgent for the regime as a whole to be repealed. Only through such drastic measures will the substantive challenges posed by ISDS be addressed. The EU has started to realise the extent of the problem posed by reverse discrimination. Following the ECJ ruling in <em>Achmea</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline78" href="#78">78</a> where it was declared that Intra-EU BITs were contrary to EU law, 23 EU Member states (all except Austria, Ireland, Finland and Sweden) have signed on 5 May 2020 the ‘Agreement for the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Member States of the European Union’. What such an agreement will reap is uncertain, but its existence certainly does signal a formal recognition of the substantive challenges contained in the ISDS regime.</p>

	     <h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>

<p><em>The economic fallout from the novel coronavirus is being felt worldwide. As a consequence, the international market chain has experienced imminent delays in performance of contractual obligations. An existing uniform international regime which can provide for effective enforceability and renegotiation of asset-based contracts is UNIDROIT: its Principles on Commercial Contracts, the Cape Town Convention, and related protocols.</em></p>

<p><em>In this context, we argue the case for the majority, the underrepresented and the most affected in this scenario: the debtors/lessors in the transport sector. We contend that the current financial crisis can be improved by adopting the alternatives that UNIDROIT instruments provide.</em></p>

<p><em>In furtherance, the three parts of our article purport to provide: i) a contextual overview of the economic impact of COVID-19 on Airlines and Railways; ii) an analysis of the condition of the Airlines and the Railway industries using the UNIDROIT documents which govern the legal aspects of this issue; and finally iii) plausible solutions to reduce this economic burden.</em></p>

<h5 id="1-unidroit-an-overview-of-the-existing-norms"><strong>1. UNIDROIT: An Overview of the Existing Norms</strong></h5>

<p>UNIDROIT’s Principles of International Commercial Contracts establish a legal framework to articulate the principles underlying asset-based financing and leasing, and protect other such related interests.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the Cape Town Convention and its Protocols are standardised rules to be followed while engaging in transnational business transactions. Specific to mobile equipment, the Convention lays down certain objectives to facilitate asset-based financing and leasing, protect the interests of all parties, and create a legal framework for international interests. The most significant aspect of the Cape Town Convention is the trifurcation between air, railway, and space assets, creating a comprehensive yet definite framework for each.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a></p>

<p>The Luxembourg Protocol utilizes the Cape Town Convention as a baseline while accommodating the specific requirements of the railway industry, integrating these elements in a vital transnational instrument. </p>

<h5 id="2-the-impact-factor"><strong>2. The Impact Factor</strong></h5>

<p>The recent COVID-19 health crisis has had a profound impact on all forms of travel and transportation. Both the aviation and railway sectors have been significant casualties of the worldwide shutdowns of domestic and cross-border trade and travel.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></p>

<p>The most significant impact on airline companies has been due to a slump in demand among travellers as a result of the multiple travel restrictions. Several airlines have declared bankruptcy,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> many have ceased operations, while other airlines reported a reduction in flights after a decade of expansion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> Statistics show that, on an average, 10% of flights around the world   were cancelled in early March 2020, in stark contrast to 2019.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> As the pandemic gained traction in late March, the recorded flight movements reduced almost 40–60% with international flights being affected the most. Unfortunately, research also shows that global recovery of passenger demand to pre-COVID-19 levels is estimated to take almost two years, with the most optimistic loss estimate being a whopping USD 84 billion (GBP 63.23 billion).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, estimates on the railway sector suggest that the fallout from the health crisis will cause global rail passenger revenue losses to the tune of USD 60 billion (GBP 45 billion) in 2020 and further seep into 2021.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The freight sector alone is expected to lose approximately USD 26 billion (GBP 19.5 billion) this year.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>Statistics from both sectors put into perspective the scale of the financial blowback being experienced by operators, investors and financial institutions. This situation has a direct impact on leasing agreements as well, as lessors will look to prematurely terminate agreements due to factors like non-payment. During these tumultuous times, the interests of various stakeholders in the concerned industry must be protected. This is where UNIDROIT’s instruments offer effective solutions.</p>

<h5 id="3-airlines"><strong>3. AIRLINES</strong></h5>

<h5 id="31-flying-and-non-performance"><u>3.1. Flying and Non-Performance<u></u></u></h5>

<p>COVID-19 has caused the termination of contractual relations, mainly due to the breach of obligations and pulling-out by major global investors from industries that were once the benchmark for stock-market performance. Primarily, the virus has devastated airlines, giving creditors or investor-firms like Berkshire Hathaway no incentive to hold on to their airline stakes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Firms have sold shares as they anticipated a huge risk sending the entire industry into a competitive spiral that could potentially damage profits, sales, and investor returns.</p>

<p>We argue that nations must therefore collectively reinstate investor optimism to help airline shares take-off. Hence, we aim to begin the discussion by <strong>i)</strong> highlighting the main UNIDROIT principles and providing our perspectives on the frustration of payment obligations by airlines, <strong>ii)</strong> elaborating on the legal protections and remedies that the UNIDROIT Convention on the International Interests in Mobile Equipment provides to affected parties.</p>

<h5 id="i-airline-payment-obligations-and-unidroit"><u>i) Airline Payment Obligations and UNIDROIT</u></h5>

<p>Aeroplanes require high-maintenance, a process that runs up millions of dollars  in costs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Periodic maintenance is not cheap either; it demands investment in building and maintaining terminals at large airports.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Airlines pay fees to airports to rent their gates and slots, which binds them to long-term contracts with operators. They are also locked into third party contractor agreements to hedge jet fuel prices.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Yet, the impossibility of performing their part of such contracts is not rare for airline companies. Therefore, UNIDROIT Principles (“Principles”) of International Commercial Contracts may take effect in suitable scenarios, and attempt to prevent global economies from periodic busts, protecting airlines’ legal rights.</p>

<h5 id="a-applicable-principles-hardship-v-force-majeure"><u>a) Applicable Principles:</u><strong><em><u> Hardship v. Force Majeure</u></em></strong></h5>

<p>A plain reading of the document reveals that the text of these Principles must serve as a model for national legislators. To that end, a comprehensive textual understanding is needed.</p>

<p>The relevant provisions for consideration are: Article 6.2.2 of the document<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>, which defines ‘hardship’; Article 7.1.7<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> which defines <em>force majeure</em>; and Comment 6 on Article 6.2.2<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> which deliberates the possibility of both occurring together. In this context, COVID-19 would become a ‘hardship’ (by virtue of it being an event beyond the control of the disadvantaged party) and a <em>force majeure</em> (as such an impediment could not have been taken into account at the time of conclusion of the contract).</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in <em>Churchill Falls v. Hydro-Québec</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a>, recently provided clarity on the first aspect: ‘hardship’. Notwithstanding that the facts of the case did not admit the adoption of the above-stated Principles, the judgment articulated important lessons on the broader obligations of contracting parties and reimposed parties’ right of renegotiation. The decision reads in the context of COVID-19, ‘…for example, in a situation of ‘hardship’ that corresponds to the description of that concept set out in the UNIDROIT Principles, the conduct of the contracting party who benefits from the change in circumstances <em>cannot be disregarded and must be assessed</em>’ (emphasis added).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> The Court also noted that an inflexible or a ‘gratuitously impatient or intransigent’ party, in these exigent circumstances, would violate the good faith duty under equity.</p>

<p>On the second aspect of <em>force majeure,</em> courts in India and other countries have generally construed that impossibility of performance pursuant to an unforeseeable event is a suitable justification in restraining specific performance obligations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Where Scottish or English regimes are concerned, the decision would not only depend on the circumstances but also on the drafting of the particular contractual provisions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> This position is similar in Singapore as well.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>However, in a factual situation where both ‘hardship’ and <em>force majeure</em> occur, as contemplated in Comment 6 of Article 6.2.2, we suggest that invoking hardship would be the best choice. Carrier organisations may need to re-evaluate the legitimate hazard that may emerge under their agreements with third-party contractors, for activities including refuelling, providing food, runway development and repairs, aeroplane maintenance and upgrades, and flight dispatches.</p>

<p>Therefore, if airlines invoke ‘hardship’ under the Principles as the rationale behind breach, they can expect not only that their non-performance be excused, but also that the terms of such long-term contracts be renegotiated for the purpose of keeping the contract alive, albeit on revised terms. These relaxations would allow them short-term benefits like improved cash-flow, as well as achieving long-term goals such as general restructuring.</p>

<h5 id="ii-suggestions-for-a-new-lease-of-life"><u>ii) Suggestions for a New Lease of Life</u></h5>

<p>This section details the protections and remedies that may be sought by airline debtors and lessors.</p>

<p>Firstly, given that the carrier organisations have suspended their businesses, it is necessary to determine if defaults would be triggered under the various financial understandings entered into by these companies. Where an occasion of default is triggered upon a <em>deliberate</em> suspension of business, such an interruption is generally an immediate outcome of governmental guidelines. That would be outside the scope of such an agreement, and fall under the purview of the Cape Town Convention.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is necessary to ascertain if an occasion of default is qualified by the ‘material adverse change’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> requirement. This would reflect on the borrower’s capacity to play out their legally binding commitments. In the event that there is a critical effect on the borrower’s capacity to pay, this will probably fulfil the widely used test of ‘material adverse change’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, it is normal that post-COVID-19 and after the lifting of lockdown orders, for reasons including budgetary and operational challenges, carrier organisations will be unable to immediately resume operations in all regions or may not be in a situation to recommission their fleets. Considering this, it would be suitable for nations to survey the occasion of default and the cessation of business in their financial agreements involving security interests.</p>

<p>It could be contended that impermanent terminations post-COVID-19 would establish said cessation of business.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Subsequently, it would be judicious for nations to introduce policies aligned with the Cape Town Convention, to allow aircraft organisations to audit their facility agreements, while considering COVID-19 related measures and the effect such measures may have on their financing plans.</p>

<p>Fourthly and finally, the carrier organisations may consider approaching their lessors for concessions according to their respective rent commitments (by virtue of the liquidity crunch resulting in falling ticket demand).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> For instance, the largest domestic airline in India InterGlobe Aviation Limited, which operates IndiGo’s fleet, has received 50% relief on supplementary rent, generally used to cover maintenance costs, as the greater part of IndiGo’s fleet remains grounded due to COVD-19.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a></p>

<p>While the lessors might be qualified to make decay demands for such concessions on rent commitments, the Convention would prevent them from doing so and would also give the lessee some leeway in these unprecedented times. Therefore, it will be advantageous to consider the alleviation bundle or concessions which a carrier organisation looks for from the lessors and which must incorporate a concurred period, with a specific amount of reimbursement to recover the unpaid rents. Such patience on occasion of default can therefore come at an expense, like delayed repayment, but also be highly beneficial to the lessees.</p>

<h5 id="32-the-road-ahead"><u>3.2. The Road Ahead<u></u></u></h5>

<p>For the industry to get back on track, states must ensure the provision of credit-financing for aviation assets to alleviate the circumstances that the increasingly bankrupt airline industry faces. Secondly, the borrowing costs must be revised and decreased in accordance with the Principles to enable economic regrowth. Thirdly, the continuous cooperation of states will ensure that consumer demand for commercial aircraft increases, thereby effectuating increased transnational air travel.</p>

<p>In the context of the judiciary and their interference in commercial contract matters, tempered literal interpretations of certain contracts have to be effected in order to protect the underlying obligations intended by the parties. Good faith confers a broad, flexible power to create law, which helps tie various legal principles to the concept of fundamental justice, depending on the circumstances, in an effort to protect contractual equilibrium.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> In the same vein, the fundamentally altered equilibrium in the aviation sector has to be set right, and nations should ratify documents such as the UNIDROIT’s Principles and render justice to those industries who are exposed to a substantially greater risk than others.</p>

<h5 id="4-railways"><strong>4. RAILWAYS</strong></h5>

<h5 id="41-addressing-financial-concerns-in-the-railway-sector"><u>4.1. Addressing financial concerns in the Railway sector<u></u></u></h5>

<p>The railway sector plays a pivotal role in keeping the gears of the global economy turning. It is estimated that by 2025, the global rolling stock market size will reach USD 75 billion (equivalent to GBP 57.1 billion).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> These numbers illustrate the sheer scale on which railways operate and, more importantly, they highlight the need for adequate safeguards for investments. This section is devoted to three aspects in this regard: i) highlighting the scope of the Luxembourg Protocol, ii) enumerating the liquidity crisis among operators, and iii) addressing the remedies it provides on insolvency. </p>

<h5 id="-42scope-of-the-luxembourg-protocol"><u> 4.2.Scope of the Luxembourg Protocol<u></u></u></h5>

<p>The Luxembourg Rail Protocol (Protocol) was ratified in 2007, using The Cape Town Convention as a broad framework, while taking into account the specific requirements of the rail industry.</p>

<p>The objective of the Protocol has been interpreted as follows: ‘<em>It seeks to facilitate, worldwide, more extensive private sector finance for rolling stock, reduce barriers to entry to the rail sector, and resolve important cross-border legal issues as a result of more diverse, extensive and less expensive private sector finance for railway rolling stock.’</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a></p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the Protocol addresses two immediate concerns in the rail sector, namely default remedies and registry provisions. Under the former, it enumerates remedies on insolvency, insolvency assistance, and provisions for debtors. The latter concern, on the other hand, encapsulates: the authority of the registrar, designation of entry points, identification of rolling stock, and notices of sale. With a wide scope in terms of its application, the Protocol has an important role to play in combating the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h5 id="i-mitigating-the-liquidity-crisis"><u>i) Mitigating the liquidity crisis</u></h5>

<p>During this crisis, certain issues have taken precedence. Low foot and freight traffic have prompted a liquidity crisis and pushed operators towards a staggering loss of revenue.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> States have been actively involved in assisting their railways over the past few years, and more so since the beginning of COVID-19.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> The French government absorbed EUR 35 million (GBP 31 billions) of debt from SNCF in 2018,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> and will help out the national operator again this financial year.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> According to the Office of National Statistics of the UK, British train companies have effectively been re-nationalised temporarily to survive,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> and Angela Merkel and the Bundestag have sought to raise the debt ceiling of the German Deutsche Bahn to cope with the crisis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a></p>

<p>While state-owned firms have more leeway, private entities are left to fend for themselves. Union Pacific has reported its worst quarter since the 2008 Financial Crisis,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> while both Canadian National and CSX experienced 18.9 and 26% drops in revenue respectively.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37,</a><a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38,</a><a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> Amtrak saw a mammoth 95% drop in ridership,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> pushing an already loss-saturated entity into restructuring its operations. Amidst the chaos, states and operators are looking for any sort of relief from incessant financial pressure.</p>

<h5 id="43-remedies-on-insolvency-and-their-applications-during-the-pandemic"><u>4.3 Remedies on insolvency and their applications during the pandemic<u></u></u></h5>

<p>The Protocol presents three different alternatives for creditors and debtors in situations where insolvency may occur.</p>

<p>In the first alternative,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> the insolvency administrator shall give possession of the rolling stock to the creditor upon default. This represents a safety net for creditors as, if the debtor’s position becomes untenable, they may take possession of tangible assets. However, there is a reasonable waiting period for the debtor to put across their case. The debtor is not precluded from using the rolling stock, as long as its value does not depreciate through such use. Most importantly, the debtor can retain possession of the rolling stock if it cures all the defaults other than a default constituted by the opening of insolvency proceedings, and has agreed to perform all future obligations under the agreement and related transaction document within the waiting period. </p>

<p>The second alternative allows the debtor to issue a notice to the creditor,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> stating its position with regards to meeting its financial obligations or allow the creditor to take possession of the stock. This option gives debtors the chance to represent their situation to creditors.</p>

<p>The final option prescribes a period within which the debtor agrees to cure all defaults and agrees to perform all future obligations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> The assets are turned over to the creditor upon a failure to do so. Prior to the completion of this cure period, the debtor is also empowered to approach a court seeking a stay on repossession of the assets, provided they can fulfil their obligations to the creditor during such suspension period.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that each contract is unique and therefore a singular solution can cause friction between the involved parties. These alternatives therefore provide three comprehensive courses of action. In the context of the current situation, the second and third alternatives are of utmost relevance. As various operators face liquidity crunches, it is practically impossible for them to meet their immediate debt obligations. Additionally, Article X of the Protocol also provides for insolvency assistance requiring courts in the contracting state to cooperate with foreign bodies and jurisdictions, which would prove to be conducive to dealing with the situation at hand.</p>

<p>However, a gradual pickup of traffic seems likely. Debtors can, therefore, likely transfer their risk to the creditors, with assurances that the situation will improve. Should a reasonable cure period be negotiated, it would ensure that debtors have adequate time to cure their obligations without sacrificing the creditors’ stakes in the operation.</p>

<h5 id="44-using-the-protocol-efficiently-to-manage-the-crisis-a-suggestion"><u>4.4 Using the Protocol efficiently to manage the crisis: A Suggestion<u></u></u></h5>

<p>Ultimately, the aforementioned statistics are just a small insight into the magnitude of COVID-19’s impact. Even the most optimistic estimates do not suggest a strong pickup of economic growth before the second half of 2021,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> and railways across the globe will continue to face contractions before a gruelling recovery.</p>

<p>Hence, debtors need to be protected from financial ruin by using the relevant insolvency provisions. At the same time, this cannot compromise on the interests of creditors. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the relevant alternatives provided by the Protocol, in order to find one that meets the expectations of all parties. Additionally, the international registry must facilitate large-scale coordination between parties. By providing pertinent information about rolling stock, the registry must aid parties in making informed decisions about the procurement, sale, and movement of such stock. On this, the Protocol has been ratified to protect the interests of various players in the field, and the pandemic could very well be its hour of reckoning.</p>

<h5 id="5-conclusion"><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></h5>

<p>The problems we have addressed arise primarily from the fact that legal systems have various approaches to securities and lease agreements, which creates uncertainty for lending institutions and borrowers regarding the efficacy of their rights. This issue can be dealt with, summarily, by adopting the foregoing measures.</p>

<p>Therefore, amidst the uncertainty around the pandemic, the implementation of the UNIDROIT Principles will be pivotal to ensure that air operators can stem the haemorrhage of money and that they will be able to return to normalcy once the crisis ends. To manage the fallout from the pandemic, the Luxembourg Protocol must be utilized to its fullest in order to provide an equitable, comprehensive and efficient method to manage the fallout from the pandemic while preparing entities to return to their normal capacities.</p>

<p>It would also be prudent to encourage a greater number of states to ratify the Cape Town Convention and its protocols in order to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive system of investment protection. We believe that the adoption of such principles for special needs during extraordinary circumstances would lead to a better global understanding of broader concepts like contractual stability and fairness: concepts which UNIDROIT has championed in the international arena.</p>

	     <h5 id="a-case-note-on-hudorovič-and-others-v-slovenia">A case note on <em>Hudorovič and Others v Slovenia</em></h5>

<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>

<p><em>Hudorovič and Others v Slovenia</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> is a case concerning Roma communities living in informal settlements who did not have adequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This case was fought in the context of Slovenia making the right to drinking water a constitutional right.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> This, however, did not become pertinent,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found no violation of Article 8<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> by a 5:2 majority in the first application, and unanimously found no violations under the other Articles and for the second application. This case note critically analyses three themes in the judgment. First, it evaluates the Court’s assessment of the right to water, contrasting it with Indian constitutional jurisprudence, and the framework proposed by the dissenting judges. It further proposes a qualified right to water in European human rights law. Second, it argues that the majority decontextualized the position of the applicants in determining socio-economic issues. They ignored the history of social exclusion and inequality faced by the Roma people and the role of the state in addressing this, contrary to the concepts of substantive equality and positive obligations. This makes this case a ‘tale of two communities’. Finally, it notes the overarching theme of socio-economic rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), examining how the nature of the application in <em>Hudorovič</em> is difficult to fit within traditional European human rights law, and explains the tensions that emerge as a result. </p>

<p>Before delving into the analysis, a brief summary of the facts is helpful. The first applicant and his son (the second applicant) in the first application lived in the informal Roma settlement of Goriča vas. Their hut had no access to water, sewage and sanitation because permits and documents could not be acquired to obtain access to public infrastructure, due to the irregular manner of establishing settlement. In the second application, a family of fourteen lived in an illegally built hut in an informal Roma settlement at Dobruška without access to water, sanitation or electricity. The applicants in both applications received monthly social assistance from the government. The applications were joined by the Court in light of the facts and substantive questions they raised. They argued violations of Articles 3<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a>, 8 and 14<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> of the Convention, alleging that their homes did not have access to basic public utilities and that they had been subjected to a negative and discriminatory attitude by local authorities. The opinion of the majority and the dissenting judges will be examined in the sections below. </p>

<p>The first issue this piece discusses is whether there is a ‘right to water’ in European human rights law. It is submitted that the Court unduly limited the right, if recognising it at all. The majority opined that there must be a threshold of severity in assessing whether a lack of access to water and sanitation can constitute an interference with Article 8. Consequently, it held that ‘access to safe drinking water is not, as such, a right’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> but that a ‘persistent and long-standing lack of access to safe drinking water can … have adverse consequences for health and human dignity effectively eroding the core of private life and the enjoyment of a home within the meaning of Article 8’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<p>This standard is notably problematic. First, it sets a high threshold with multiple components, such as the persistence and long-standing nature of the lack of access, which is complicated and may be challenging to prove. Second, the test is uncertain and ambiguous. It is unclear what the <em>core</em> of private life is in this case and what <em>factors</em> would erode it. A threat to survival would undeniably be included, but the boundary becomes blurry after that, especially when concepts such as human dignity and private life are involved, the meanings of which reasonable people may disagree on. This leads to uncertainty about whether an applicant is protected by the Convention at all and could also lead to demarcations which may cause some injustice based on who may fall outside the standard, and thus be without protection. Third, it is not clear what is gained by categorically rejecting a right to water. Following the Court’s jurisprudence on qualified rights, a right to water may have been recognised and limited in the public interest, such as the prevailing socio-economic circumstances, leading to no violation. On the other hand, to say that there is no prima facie right places the burden on the already disadvantaged applicant to prove why she should have the right, instead of requiring the state to outline why the right was not fulfilled. Thus, a consequentialist approach (focusing on the consequences of the act e.g. health concerns) further erodes human rights, which a deontological approach (based on the intrinsic value of the right to water) does not.</p>

<p>Contrast the majority’s approach with Indian jurisprudence, which has taken a different approach to the same question. The Indian Supreme Court acknowledged that there is a right to water guaranteed by Article 21 (right to life) of the Indian Constitution.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Since water is essential for human life to exist (in the Indian context), the much broader concept of private life (in European human rights jurisprudence), which essentially concerns itself with the <em>quality</em> of life,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> should include it as well. Additionally, it is worth noting that the usual constraints based on resource allocation are even more severe in a developing country such as India, so the weight attached to these arguments, at least for some countries in Europe, needs to be revaluated when balancing them against the right to a basic necessity. Even if these become critical factors for some states, they can be balanced at the proportionality stage, while still acknowledging that water is a right and not a privilege. </p>

<p>The partially dissenting opinion (Judge Pavli joined by Judge Kūris) proposed a middle ground between the majority’s standard and the one proposed above, under which it would be sufficient to prove adverse consequences stemming from lack of access for an extended period. However, this leads to the issues highlighted above, related to proving consequences and their graveness, since the applicant would have to prove that there were harmful effects on their dignity, for instance, and that these were caused by a lack of access to water for an extended period. This second limb not only requires proving causation, but also the temporal aspect of the persistence of the deprivation. Due to these difficulties, the prima facie right model is a better framework, as it would require a presumption of the adverse consequences and the state would then have to justify these. The dissenting opinion did allude to this subsequently, noting that ‘[s]uch a right cannot, of course, be absolute’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a>, and consequently noted that this predicament ‘adversely affects core private life interests and basic human dignity,’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> by definition closer to the prima facie right model explained above. Thus, the model of starting with a qualified right to water and then addressing situations in which it may be limited is better suited to tackling these issues, which the majority’s opinion fails to acknowledge, but one reading of the minority opinion hints at. </p>

<h5 id="social-exclusion-and-inequality">Social exclusion and inequality</h5>

<p>The second theme in the judgment is a lack of sensitivity to context i.e. the social position of the Roma community, generally and in this particular case. The Court had earlier acknowledged in <em>Winterstein and Others v France</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> that the Roma constitute a vulnerable minority, and that states ought to pay special consideration towards their needs. In spite of this, the majority in <em>Hudorovič</em> used the wide margin of appreciation in socio-economic matters to decontextualize their plight. Thus, once it was satisfied that Slovenia had made <em>some</em> efforts to realise its positive obligations, it did not ask whether this framework for providing access to utilities reached the marginalised. This is not to say that the Court should not defer to policy judgements of elected national representatives, but that it should assess the differential impact that a policy may have and whether the state is taking effective steps to mitigate that. </p>

<p>This can be seen in three aspects of the judgment which at best ignore and at worst legitimise the discrimination faced by the applicants, albeit unintentionally. First, the judgment individualised a public good by noting that the state can reasonably leave installation of connections to the expense of individuals. This fails to acknowledge the disadvantaged position that many individuals (or communities) may be in, exacerbated by social exclusion. It is submitted that even if this can be the system for the majority, having positive obligations means that the state should at least assist those who do not have adequate means. Second, it was emphasised that the applicants were receiving social benefits, which could be used to improve their conditions. However, there was no assessment of whether these would cover this infrastructural investment, since social benefits aim to aid daily expenditure. Third, the Court noted other efforts, such as water tank deliveries, made by the state to ensure access ‘irrespective of how and whether it was realised’ in its assessment of Article 3.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> However, the minority pointed out the findings of independent expert missions which practically unanimously said that water tank deliveries were inadequate.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> It is unclear why making <em>any</em> effort was seen as an end in itself, when the goal was to ensure access for the community. Therefore, whether social security benefits and other policies were effective in ensuring the right to water or whether the applicants could in reality take matters into their own hands was never critically examined.</p>

<p>Finally, also noteworthy in the judgment is the lack of attention paid to the bigger picture, i.e. unequal social relations. The Human Rights Centre of the University of Ghent<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> noted that ‘forms of unequal treatment in Slovenia included preferential treatment of non-Roma in the development of infrastructure and the systemic failure to develop infrastructure in Roma communities.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Moreover, issues related to water and sanitation can not only be a <em>form</em> of discrimination, but also <em>perpetuate</em> discrimination. Unsanitary living conditions can lead to stigmatisation of a historically disadvantaged community and further alienate them from the majority. In light of this, it is questionable why the Court did not examine the Article 14 claim separately. What the applicants claimed was not merely a <em>lack</em> of access to water, but <em>differential</em> access, based on them belonging to the Roma community. The majority instead noted that access to sanitation facilities was limited in Slovenia, even in the majority areas, to absolve the state of its obligation to extend facilities to a marginalised community. This was exacerbated by an emphasis on the illegality of their housing, which meant that the state could forsake its positive obligations. This has rightly been criticised as an ‘overly formalistic approach’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> and the minority too criticised this eloquently:</p>

<p>“[T]here is nothing objectionable about a State seeking to discourage illegal constructions and preserve public order by legally restricting their access to public utilities. However, in the specific context of Roma communities … the legality argument has been repeatedly rejected by this Court …“<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a></p>

<p>The minority also explicitly acknowledged the acts of ‘less-than-friendly’ local authorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> This alludes to direct discrimination, a claim made by the applicants themselves, who argued that the state had failed to consider their needs as members of a disadvantaged group, indicated by discriminatory attitudes, prejudice and stereotypes of local authorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> Thus, it is important to focus on the historical <em>context</em> to closely scrutinise the applicants’ claims, but in the majority opinion it seemed as though the role of the state in discrimination against Roma communities was not only ignored, but also inadvertently legitimised by focusing on formalism and uncritically accepting any policy effort. </p>

<h5 id="socio-economic-rights-and-the-convention">Socio-economic rights and the Convention</h5>

<p>The ECHR, a product of the post-war period, ‘focuses almost entirely on the traditional canon of civil and political rights,’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> even purposefully omitting socio-economic rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> However, the Court’s case law has laid down the foundation for socio-economic rights as complementing the Convention.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Contrary to being unfaithful to the text, this is a means of ensuring that the Convention remains dynamic and evolves with changing times, such as the inclusion of rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which found no mention in the original text.</p>

<p>Yet this chasm between text and jurisprudence leads to certain tensions. For instance, the Article 14 jurisprudence has been criticised for being formalistic.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> This can be seen in the present case too. A wide margin of appreciation led to minimal examination of the claims the state was making about its infrastructure, which means deference to executive authorities. Subsequently, an ahistorical assessment meant that factors such as the illegality of the housing were taken into account, an instance of the underlying formalism in <em>Hudorovič</em> (see above). In spite of this critique, an examination of Article 14 was crucial in this case for reasons explained previously (i.e. the unequal distribution of public utilities). </p>

<p>Others have argued that there is also an inherent bias in the Court’s Article 8 jurisprudence, towards negative interference instead of positive obligations associated with socio-economic rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> While the Court has produced some path-breaking judgments on positive obligations in the past, this critique finds some support in <em>Hudorovič</em>. The traditional role of Article 8 was to prevent adverse state action and not to mandate it to do something, the classic distinction drawn between negative and positive rights. Thus, there is some hesitation in examining the state’s current efforts and legally mandating it to do more in the judgment, which would require significant infrastructural investment. Another tension can also be seen in balancing the role of judges and the government,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> which invites the criticism of deference made above, but also raises questions about the limits of the law and judicial expertise. For instance, to what extent can a court assess the budgetary allocations the state must make in order to fulfil its legal obligation of providing public utilities? Hence, there is some reluctance to find socio-economic rights as coming within the protection of private and family life.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Hudorovič</em> was about social inequality. In side-stepping that, the judgment shows the uneasy position of socio-economic rights in European human rights law. The dissenting opinion captures the crux of the issue perfectly:</p>

<p>If one looks beyond formalities, the case of the first applicants from Goriča vas is ultimately a tale of two communities, one Roma and one belonging to the majority, living a stone’s throw from each other – one of them has running water coming out of their taps, and the other has never had it at all for over thirty years. This in a country with an annual GDP per capita upwards of 20,000 euros.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a></p>

<p>One may argue that remaining faithful to the original text is more important than its judge-led evolution, and the tensions noted above only reinforce that. However, the context in which cases are argued in front of the Strasbourg Court has changed considerably since the Second World War, and as state action into the lives of individuals and communities increases, so does its obligations and responsibilities,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> especially towards those who have historically been at the margins of European society. To turn a blind eye to what some may call ‘state-sanctioned’ poverty’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> is as much a human rights violation as any other. This judgment, unfortunately, does nothing to recognise that, and the consequence of that is upholding an unequal status quo:</p>

<p>“The finding of no violation by the majority … will contribute little, I fear, to alleviating the plight of inequality and disadvantage that many European Roma continue to face.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a></p>

<h5 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h5>

<p>This case note has examined the tensions in the case of <em>Hudorovič and Others v Slovenia</em> under the umbrella of the relationship between socio-economic rights and the ECHR. It has critiqued the judgment for its failure to protect, or sufficiently protect, the right to water. It has also contextualised this right in a historically unequal society, noting that the Court did not pay adequate attention to this factual background. Finally, it located this case and others like it within a larger debate about whether and how non-traditional rights are to be enforced in European human rights law, concluding that while the jurisprudence may have its shortcomings, the cost of not recognising these rights is far too high. Since human rights law is constantly evolving and recognising new rights and rights-bearers, one can hope that the status quo would change some day. </p>

	     <h5 id="a-critical-review-of-the-ecjs-judgments-on-gmail-and-skype-out">A critical review of the ECJ’s Judgments on ‘Gmail’ and ‘Skype Out’</h5>

<h5 id="abstract">Abstract:</h5>

<p><em>The Over-the-Top (OTT) services have successfully competed with “traditional” telecommunications services and disrupted the market for short messages, phone and video calls. While WhatsApp alone processed an average of over 65 billion messages per day in May 2018, this is true for “only” 22.7 billion messages sent via SMS. The stunning success of OTT services like Gmail, Viber, Skype etc. is also due to the different regulation frameworks that apply to telecommunications services and OTT services. With its judgments on</em> Gmail <em>and</em> Skype Out <em>in June 2019 the ECJ finally clarified the legal situation,  subjecting</em> Skype Out <em>under telecommunications law, but not</em> Gmail. <em>This essay shall give a short overview on the key findings of the ECJ’s judgments, critically evaluating the argumentation of the court.</em></p>

<h5 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h5>

<p>The rise of the Web 2.0, the widespread distribution of smart phones, and the development of new digital platforms have shaken many economic branches and turned a great number of business models upside down. This is especially true for the telecommunication sector where so-called “Over the Top” (OTT) services have successfully competed with “traditional” telecommunications services and disrupted the market for short messages, phone and video calls. <a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> The stunning success of OTT-services like <em>Gmail</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em>, <em>Skype</em> etc. is due to many factors. Yet, it cannot be overlooked that the market is no “level playing field”, especially regarding  European regulation.               </p>

<p>When regulating these services, internet access providers (IAP) are treated differently than internet service providers (ISP). The regulatory framework of the transmission of signals is different to that of the transmission of content. This relates to the distinct roles assumed by ISPs and IAPs in the digital market. The service of an ISP is brought to the user over the open internet. ISPs usually don’t operate their own network infrastructures, but run software and, if necessary, some central servers. They provide almost all imaginable services rendered via the internet and range from chat applications and social networks (<em>WhatsApp</em>, <em>WeChat</em>, <em>Facebook</em>) to streaming services (<em>Netflix</em>, <em>Amazon</em> <em>Prime</em>, <em>YouTube</em>) and e-commerce platforms (<em>ebay</em>, <em>Amazon</em>, <em>alibaba</em>). The service of the IAPs, on the other hand, is limited to connecting the user (and often the ISPs too) to the internet. They only provide internet access and have no influence on the nature or content of the ISPs’ services. However,  IAPs are essential for ISPs as their services couldn’t be brought to the users without internet connectivity. An IAP provides individuals access to the internet, employing a range of technologies to connect users via their own network with the open internet. Larger IAP companies in the UK are, for example, <em>Vodafone</em>, <em>British Telecom</em> or <em>Three</em>.</p>

<p>ISPs or “information society services”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> are subject to an array of different European directives depending on the kind of services they are offering, whereas IAPs are mainly regulated by the “Framework Directive for Electronic Communications Networks and Services” (Directive 2002/21/EC) and its related directives. These two frameworks differ significantly in their respective approaches and their levels of regulation. While the telecommunication sector has traditionally been heavily regulated, OTT services are almost not regulated at all.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> It is, therefore, hardly surprising that one of the top priorities of the “Digital Single Markets Strategy” of the European Commission is to create “[…] the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish”. According to the European Commission, this requires “[…] the right regulatory conditions for innovation, investment, fair competition and a level playing field.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<p>In addition, regulatory authorities have repeatedly attempted to subject OTT service providers to the same regulation as “traditional” telecommunications providers by classifying them as providers of “electronic communications services” in the meaning of Art. 2 lit. c Directive 2002/21/EC.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> As this would mean a much stricter regulation on OTT services and a significant increase in power for regulatory authorities, this matter was highly controversial until the ECJ issued  two fundamental judgements on the email service <em>Gmail</em> of Google<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> and the VoIP service <em>Skype Out</em> of Skype Communications.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> This essay shall give a short overview on the key findings of the ECJ and critically evaluate the argumentation of the court.</p>

<h5 id="ii-essential-technical-features-of-gmail-and-skype-out">II. Essential technical features of “Gmail” and “Skype Out”</h5>

<p>In the aforementioned cases, the ECJ adopts a functional-technical interpretation of the law. A technical understanding of the characteristics of the respective OTT service is essential. The BEREC<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> describes OTT services as “a content, a service or an application that is provided to the end user over the public internet”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> However, as this definition refers more to the method of the provision, rather than a particular type of service, it does not yet provide any understanding of the concept. Almost any available service on the internet could then be qualified as an OTT service.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> As this essay focuses on competitive effects of OTT services on the telecommunications industry, only those OTT services which enable individual communication over the internet and offer an alternative to “traditional” telecommunications services shall be deemed to be OTT services.</p>

<p>The services <em>Gmail</em> and <em>Skype Out</em> differ mostly in their technical structure. <em>Gmail</em> provides its users with a service that enables them to send and receive emails and data over the internet. The service is based on a ‘client server architecture’. This  means that all relevant user data is processed, stored, and forwarded to other internet users over central servers. It associates the email addresses with the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the corresponding terminal device, splits the messages into data packets, and uploads them or receives them from the internet for the purposes of transmitting them to their recipients. The conveyance of signals occurs essentially over the open internet.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Internet access providers transmit those signals on behalf of the user as a service rendered under a service contract with the user.</p>

<p>Skype Communications offers the <em>Skype Out</em> service as an additional feature of the communication software <em>Skype.</em>  This allows users to make calls from a terminal, where the software is installed, to a fixed or mobile telephone line using the Internet Protocol. The signal is first conveyed by an internet access provider, over the open internet, to a gateway where the further transmission is carried out by a telecommunications service provider via the PSTN.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> For this purpose, Skype Communications has concluded an agreement with the telecommunications service provider which is also remunerated for its services.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a></p>

<h5 id="iii-the-legal-classification-by-the-ecj">III. The legal classification by the ECJ</h5>

<p>The key issue in both judgements of the ECJ is whether the service delivered by the OTT service providers “[…] consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a></p>

<p>The court begins in the <em>Gmail</em> case by emphasizing the regulatory distinction between the production of content and the transmission of content, since “[…] content and transmission [are] being covered by different measures which pursue their own specific objectives”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> However, what at first sight seems to be a simple and clear distinction is blurred by the court itself as it admits in the <em>Skype Out</em> and <em>Gmail</em> cases that the OTT services convey signals on electronic communications networks. Therefore, the court goes on, the service must consist <em>wholly or mainly</em> in the conveyance of signals in order to be classified as an electronic communications service and this is only the case with <em>Skype Out</em>. In the case of <em>Gmail</em>, it is mainly the IAPs of the senders and recipients which convey the signals necessary for the functioning of the service. By applying a quantitative criterion in its assessment, the court follows the technology-neutral approach of the Framework Directive.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Yet, the distinction between the production and the transmission of content is less plausible due to the arbitrary evaluation of open terms (“<em>wholly or mainly”)</em> by the court. In order to substantiate its reasoning with a more objective criterion the court introduces therefore the concept of responsibility. The decisive factor is according to the court whether the provider is ultimately responsible to the user for the proper functioning of the service. The court states in both cases that “[…] all that matters […] is that that the provider is responsible vis-à-vis the end-users for transmission of the signal”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Whilst the participation of <em>Gmail</em> in the sending and receiving of messages “[…] does not appear to be sufficient to [regard the service of <em>Gmail</em>] as consisting ‘wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals’, the court holds that Skype Communications has assumed responsibility vis-à-vis the end-users for the transmission of voice signals on the PSTN<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> only by the (contractual) involvement of telecommunications service providers authorised to send and terminate calls to fixed or mobile telephone numbers via the PSTN. As a consequence, the ECJ considers only <em>Skype Out</em> to be an ‘electronic communications service’, while <em>Gmail</em> remains unregulated by the Framework Directive.</p>

<h5 id="iv-critical-evaluation">IV. Critical evaluation</h5>

<p>The findings of the court are noteworthy considering the fact that Google itself owns an internet connected network infrastructure, which is also used for the purposes of the conveyance of signals for <em>Gmail</em>. However, this is “of no relevance to the classification of the nature of the service” for the court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Yet, following the logic of the ECJ leads to very strange results. Would the court have ruled differently if Skype Communications had its own PSTN infrastructure? What if Google only rented its infrastructure? The court does not deliver any explanation on why an internet connected network infrastructure and a PSTN should be treated differently in the regulatory classification of OTT services. The strong focus on the technical architecture gives the outcome of the legal assessment a arbitrary appearance. The different classification of the two OTT service providers is even more puzzling when the fact that Skype Communications excluded, in its general terms and conditions, any liability for the transmission of signals to the end-users is taken into account. Viewed from the end-users’ perspective, only the ISP and the telecommunications service provider remain responsible for transmitting the signals.</p>

<p>The further arguments of the court are unconvincing too. The court states, “[t]he fact that Google must be regarded as supplying electronic communications services as the operator of its own electronic communications networks […] does not mean that all the web-based services which it supplies must also be treated as electronic communications services, even though they do not consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> This argument is void, only reaffirming  in numerous words the statement of the court that it does not consider the electronic communications networks of Google in the classification of <em>Gmail</em>. Legal or technical arguments in this regard are nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the judgements lack  a definition to the term of “service” within the meaning of Art. 2 lit. c) Framework Directive. Many services consist of several different sub-services such as Voice over IP, messaging or communication with chatbots. If the key criterion is whether “the service” consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals, a sharp definition of what features amount to a “service” is essential. Nonetheless, the court leaves many questions unanswered in this regard. The court fails to establish clear criteria as to when a particular feature of a provider is to be regarded as a service in the meaning of the Framework Directive. Especially in the case of <em>Skype Out</em>, a clear outline of the term would have been desirable, as the installation of the <em>Skype Out</em> feature on a terminal requires the prior installation of the Skype software, which already offers an array of (sub-)services that cannot be classified as ‘electronic communications services’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> In the end, the judgement of the ECJ represents a missed opportunity to put things right. A teleological approach, which also takes into account the competitive substitution effect of OTT services, would have been more appropriate. Above all, the different classification is flawed as both services provide their users with classical individual communication tools. Content-related components are fading into the background or do not even exist. Both services should be treated equally.</p>

<p>The Administrative Court of Cologne, in the lower instance, had focused on whether <em>Gmail</em> had “factually adopted” the signal transmission of the IAP and stated that it is <em>the user</em> that “gives the decisive impulse for signal transmission”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> The court therefore concluded that <em>Gmail</em> makes an essential contribution to the functioning of the telecommunication process and qualifies as an ‘electronic communications service’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> This approach leaves the technical particularities out of the picture and focuses on the functionalities of the <em>Gmail</em> service. As this legal view would subject both services - <em>Gmail</em> and <em>Skype Out</em> – equally to telecommunications regulation, it is only to be welcomed. However, the application of regulatory means and measures requires the utmost tact and sensitivity in order to maintain the inventive strength of OTT services. The challenge for authorities will be to establish a regulatory balance between data protection, consumer protection and a functioning market without stifling innovation and industry growth.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <h5 id="introduction">Introduction:</h5>

<p>In its recent report, the ILC addressed two main outstanding issues relating to <em>jus cogens</em> norms: the existence of regional <em>jus cogens</em> and the possibility of an illustrative list.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> The report concludes with draft conclusion 24, which proposes a non-exhaustive list of the “most widely recognised”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> peremptory norms, such as the prohibition of genocide and aggressive use of force. Peremptory norms are no doubt a “positive part of international law,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> yet are still conceptualised by some as “a dramatic (or threatening) magic.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> The ILC’s report is perhaps an attempt to concretise <em>jus cogens</em> as, in Kolb’s words, an “operational concept of law”, rather than a mere extension of natural law theory or lofty ideals. This post offers the thesis that, whilst such a mission is admirable, the operation of peremptory norms as envisaged by the ‘hierarchy theory’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> remains impeded by the dominance of treaties as a source of international law. Furthermore, this seems unlikely to change in the immediate future because treaties are a primary vehicle for the enforcement of state sovereignty, which remains paramount in an international legal sphere dominated by positivist notions of state consent. The conflict is thus characterised by the dichotomy between <em>realpolitik</em> and international ideals.</p>

<p>‘Treaty’ will be used in the sense envisaged by Article 2(1)(a) VCLT – “[a]n international agreement concluded between states… and governed by international law…”. This post proceeds from the definition of ‘peremptory norm’ offered by H.R. Fabri, who characterises it as a “hierarchy (of norms) … linked in turn with the idea of safeguarding… a supposedly universal, common core of human values.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> Another critical feature of <em>jus cogens</em> norms is pointed out by Kolb, who states that such a norm “does not allow derogation”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a>; likewise, Ragazzi highlights the “disability” of States to “contract out of” a norm of <em>jus cogens.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The non-conditionality of peremptory norms would seem to make their applicability a simple matter, but this is not borne out in reality for several reasons. Firstly, the article considers the treatment of peremptory norms and treaties by international courts; secondly, it considers the socio-legal importance of treaties and *jus cogens</em> norms.</p>

<p>The issue of the hierarchy theory, and the operation of peremptory norms versus treaties, remains important despite the large volumes of literature on the subject. If peremptory norms are to assume the role assigned to them – to protect normative ideals and prevent gross infringements of human rights – they must have practical bite. The obstacles to progression must therefore be recognised in order to be overcome. There is otherwise the danger that peremptory norms become merely a theoretical ideal.</p>

<h6 id="1-courts-and-the-hierarchy-theory-"><u>1) Courts and the Hierarchy Theory </u></h6>

<p>The consequences of <em>jus cogens</em> norms are made explicitly clear by Art. 53 VCLT 1969: “A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law.” Furthermore, Art. 64 gives retrospective application to <em>jus cogens</em>: “If a new peremptory norm of general international law emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates.” This embodies the ‘hierarchy’ or ‘trumping’ argument, as expressed by Bates: <em>jus cogens</em> norms are to prevail over all other sources of international law, including treaties.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> However, although <em>jus cogens</em> are certainly acknowledged by international courts, it is argued that they are a less favoured means of deciding cases than treaties. Crawford admits that they remain “something of a curiosity”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a>. Hence, “few are the instances in which a court or tribunal has applied the concept so as to determine the outcome of a case.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> This is a critical observation illustrated by the case of <em>Al-Adsani.</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a></p>

<p>In <em>Al-Adsani</em>, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rejected the argument that application of the doctrine of state immunity to Kuwait, under the SIA 1978, infringed his rights under Art. 3 ECHR (prohibition on torture) and Art. 6 (right to a fair trial). The applicant argued that his claim related to torture, the prohibition of which is a <em>jus cogens</em> norm, and hence such prohibition took “precedence over treaty law and other rules of international law”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a>. A majority of 9:8 held that the Art.3 right had not been infringed: “notwithstanding” the “special character” of the prohibition of torture, the Court found itself unable to discern in the “the international instruments, judicial authorities or other materials” any basis for the applicant’s argument.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>  The case is significant because, as a treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be hierarchically subordinate to the prohibition of torture as a <em>jus cogens</em> norm. Thus, according to the hierarchy theory, the ECHR was the wrong yardstick by which to measure the applicant’s case.</p>

<p>Of particular note is the centrality of multilateral treaties in the Court’s reasoning – the court noted that “none of the primary international instruments referred to (Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 2 and 4 of the UN Convention) relates to civil proceedings or to State immunity.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> This is illuminating as it suggests that the ‘hierarchy’ envisaged by the VCLT 1969 is not being enforced at the judicial level. If the hierarchy model is correct, the <em>jus cogens</em> prohibition of torture should have taken clear precedence, such that recourse to the aforementioned treaties would be irrelevant. If peremptory norms are at the apex of the hierarchy, why mention treaties at all?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Court referred to the ILC’s 1999 Report on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Citing the working group’s findings, it noted that whilst some states had shown “some sympathy” for the idea that state immunity should be waived where it conflicted with peremptory norms, “in most cases… the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> The Concurring Opinion of Judge Pellonpää joined by Sir Nicolas Bratza is also illuminating:</p>

<p>“Although giving absolute priority to the prohibition of torture may at first sight seem very “progressive”, a more careful consideration tends to confirm that such a step would also run the risk of proving a sort of “Pyrrhic victory”. International cooperation, including cooperation with a view to eradicating the vice of torture, presupposes the continuing existence of certain elements of a basic framework for the conduct of international relations.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a></p>

<p>This suggests a certain judicial reticence in developing international law beyond what is accepted by states. The Court’s reasoning appears to be driven by two main considerations: i) the lack of state practice in waiving state immunity in favour of <em>jus cogens</em> norms; ii) the centrality of state immunity in diplomatic relations between states, and the policy implications of impeding such immunity. This is clearly at odds with the functionality envisaged by the ILC report, which requires <em>jus cogens</em> to ‘trump’ treaties in order to fulfil their role of safeguarding human rights considerations.</p>

<p>It may be argued that the hierarchical concept of <em>jus cogens</em> was nevertheless acknowledged in the <em>Al-Adsani</em> judgment: the Joint Dissenting Opinion considered that “the basic characteristic of a <em>jus cogens</em> rule is that, as a source of law in the now vertical international legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same status.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Thus, the hierarchy theory is acknowledged by at least some amongst the judiciary. However, this does not convince as a counterargument. As Bates points out, <em>jus cogens</em> “only really featured in the reasoning of the minority, with the majority taking their stand on different reasoning.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> This post has already illustrated how the reasoning of the majority centred around multilateral treaties and policy considerations. Moreover, Bates persuasively suggests that this is not merely an outlier amidst a sea of acceptance of the hierarchy theory: he cites the  <em>Arrest Warrant Case</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> as illustration of the fact that “a <em>jus cogens</em> norm did not automatically make ineffective other rules of international law.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> Both the <em>Arrest Warrant Case</em> and the case of <em>Jones</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> are examples of rulings in which claims to state immunity were upheld despite suspected violations of jus cogens norms. In <em>Jones</em>, the House of Lords upheld Saudi Arabia’s claim to state immunity despite the applicants’ allegations of torture at the hands of Saudi officials. This “hammered another nail in the coffin”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> of the hierarchy theory, and indeed it submitted that the theory is currently treading water. Whether it will remain so in the future is beyond the scope of this post.</p>

<p>A final possible counter-argument against this state of affairs may be found in the argument of Cassese, who suggests that no “consistent practice”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> of <em>jus cogens</em> norm by states is necessary to render them operational; it is sufficient for members of the international community to “evince” acceptance of the norm. The rejection of ‘consistent practice’ as the benchmark of recognition would seem to imply that any statement by a state indicating acceptance of a norm as <em>jus cogens</em> would do. The implications of this argument are thus that enforcement of the hierarchy theory by courts is neither here nor there: <em>jus cogens</em> are operational, whether or not this is reflected in practice. This is superficially attractive as an argument: it seems to adhere to the intuition that the highest human rights ideals, such as prohibition of genocide and torture, should not depend for their existence on the whims of States or courts. For example, it is not seriously contested that prohibition of torture is a <em>jus cogens</em> norm, even though States have and do torture individuals.</p>

<p>However, Cassese ultimately provides the correct answer to the wrong question. “Most” international lawyers accept the existence of <em>jus cogens</em> and also accept their “operation” within a system of international law, as pointed out by O’Connell.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> What this post questions about, however, is the practical operation of <em>jus cogens</em> <em>vis-à-vis treaties</em>. In this sense, Cassese is over-idealistic. The idea that peremptory norms trump all other sources of international law is a hollow statement if courts reject the hierarchy in the first place. According greater importance to treaties becomes an easier way of ensuring that the development of international law does not too often outpace what is accepted by states (since treaties, by definition, are built around the intentions of the parties). Lord Lloyd-Jones concurs with the approach in <em>Al-Adsani</em>: there is a need for “judicial restraint in developing international law beyond what is accepted by States.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Cassese himself acknowledges the lack of ‘bite’ of <em>jus cogens</em>: it has “never had the effect proper to the notion,”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> i.e., to nullify a treaty contrary to its content. Cassese conversely posits that <em>jus cogens</em> have “perhaps”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> fulfilled a deterring role by forestalling the conclusion of agreements contrary to peremptory norms, and thus cannot be characterised as a “flop”. However, this is firstly very difficult to prove beyond doubt, and secondly, as seen by the examples given in section 2), States can and do enter into and revoke treaty obligations even if this will have a deprecative effect on <em>jus cogens</em> norms (for example, the withdrawal from a treaty designed to impede aggression and/or use of nuclear weapons).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> It is ultimately difficult to reconcile Cassese’ faith in the theoretical success of <em>jus cogens</em> with the practice of states and courts.</p>

<p>The explanation for <em>jus cogen’s</em> lack of bite is helpfully spelled out by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, as referenced by O’Connell.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> This stated that:</p>

<p>“… the only method of deriving [<em>jus cogens</em>] [is] judicial determination. Thus, it [is] left to the judge to extract <em>jus cogens</em> limitations from the legal system as a whole…“<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a></p>

<p>Hence, the ‘hierarchy theory’, despite its embodiment in Arts. 53 and 64 VCLT, appears to have been declawed by the Courts. Peremptory norms may not depend on state practice for their existence but, in realistic terms, they depend on judicial enforcement for their operation as the ‘trump cards’ of international law. It is submitted that this will significantly impede the fulfilment, in practice, of Kolb’s conception of <em>jus cogens</em> as an “operational concept of law”. Deprived of a bite, <em>jus cogens</em> cede their position in the normative hierarchy of international law to treaties.</p>

<h6 id="2-jus-cogens-as-new-international-law"><u>2) <i>Jus Cogens</i> as new international law?</u></h6>

<p>On a final note, this article turns to the argument that <em>jus cogens</em> will supersede treaties as a source of international law because they are representative of a ‘new’ international order, in which human rights concerns prevail. Cassese aptly summarises this position: <em>jus cogens</em> are a “hallmark” of the “<em>new</em> international community” – for the first time, peremptory norms restrain the “hitherto unlimited lawmaking power of states.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> They thus represent a “novel approach” to international relations in which “community concerns”, to some extent, prevail over States’ self-interest. The inference is that peremptory norms are the better means of delivering outcomes which adhere to international human rights standards, whilst treaties are somewhat outmoded because they promote state or party sovereignty.</p>

<p>There is the potential for discussion on this point which far exceeds the scope of this post. Nonetheless, it is sufficient for our purposes to briefly point out that this argument falls into the familiar trap of over-simplification. It is true that <em>jus cogens</em> represents an inroad into ‘traditional’ sources of international law, insofar as they are normative safeguards of the most basic human rights. However, it is a mistake to suppose that i) treaties are no longer ‘contemporary’, or that ii) there is no overlap in normative function between treaties and <em>jus cogens</em> – treaties can also play a role in safeguarding human rights. International law is “shaped and constrained” by the “norms” of international society,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> but this is not the exclusive purview of <em>jus cogens</em> alone.</p>

<p>Recent developments are an apt reminder of the prevalence of treaties as a source of international obligations. In 2017, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Stalled negotiations between the EU and Switzerland over a treaty have disrupted “cross-border share trading and strained bilateral ties.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a>  As of August 2nd, 2019, the US formally withdrew from the 1987 INF Treaty.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Treaties, rather than <em>jus cogens</em>, still form the blueprint for many international agreements and developments. Treaties concretise the intentions of states and, thus, reaffirm state sovereignty. This is not a function which can be overtaken by peremptory norms as these are not concerned with States’ self-interest. This is nonetheless not to say that the two share some roles; notably, their  mutual capacity to safeguard normative ideals.</p>

<p>In her May 2019 lecture at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, Leila Sadat<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> dealt extensively with the role of the Rome Statute in establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the challenges posed to the Treaty by protectionist State policies. This serves as a pertinent example of a treaty which, in establishing the ICC, performed a human rights function in ensuring a mechanism by which perpetrators of the worst abuses could be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Admittedly, however, the need to remain vigilant as to the implications of <em>realpolitik</em> and state practice remains: for example, US National Security Advisor John Bolton has previously attacked the ICC,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> potentially undermining the work of the court in enforcing <em>jus cogens</em> norms in relation to crimes against humanity. The US is also not a State Party to the Rome Statute, despite its ratification by many other States. Politics has the potential to outflank legality insofar as state sovereignty remains decisive. Thus, the problem of less-than-ideal political realities in enforcing <em>jus cogens</em> is not fully satisfied either by a reliance solely on treaties or solely on courts. Nonetheless, the power of treaties as a source of international law remains strong because they are a convenient means of safeguarding the interests of individual states. Peremptory norms often do not have this advantage, unless they happen to be embedded in treaties which provide some service to the interests of states: for example, Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the “threat or use of force” against the “territorial integrity or political independence” of any State. This embodies the peremptory norm against aggression or use of force. However, it is also beneficial to states insofar as it provides some protection for their territorial and political sovereignty.</p>

<p>In sum, it is perhaps a disservice to peremptory norms to compartmentalise them wholly from treaties. If <em>jus cogens</em> are to be effective, they must represent concrete action as well as lofty ideals. This is best understood when it is recognised that <em>jus cogens</em> are merely one route to a common destination. Future enforcement of <em>jus cogens</em> may, in theory, be made more effective by a flexible approach which considers treaties and <em>jus cogens</em> (especially where a treaty purports to represent <em>jus cogens</em>) in tandem. Unfortunately, the discussion of the <em>Al-Adsani</em> case in section 1) above demonstrates the judicial tendency to consider <em>jus cogens</em> in isolation from treaties and to give preference to the treaties.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Kolb rightly concludes that “there can be no doubt as to the necessity of the notion of <em>jus cogens</em> in a fully-fledged legal order whose development has moved beyond the most primitive stages…“<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> Peremptory norms play a vital function in policing the normativity of international law. However, at least two significant problems have emerged from this discussion: i) peremptory norms are dependent on judicial enforcement and thus their efficacy is compromised, as the case of <em>Al-Adsani</em> demonstrates; ii) reliance on treaties remains a tempting alternative in cases where policy or state practice would render the enforcement of a <em>jus cogens</em> norm inconvenient. The cumulative effect of these issues is to remove the practical bite from Arts. 53 and 64 VCLT. Without implementation by international courts, the hierarchy argument is little more than a theoretical ideal. Hence, whilst the ILC Report is right to highlight other issues, such as the controversy over regional <em>jus cogens</em>, the comprehensive image of peremptory norms envisioned by the report’s draft conclusion 24 is as yet an ideal. The chasm between the archetype and the reality is something which must be resolved if peremptory norms are to keep up with treaties as a means of resolving cases in international law. Hopefully there may yet be a reconciliation of Cassese’ faith in <em>jus cogens</em> and political realism.</p>

	     <h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>

<p>US protectionist measures in modern history reached a new apex in 2018 when tariffs against steel and aluminium imports were announced, which particularly affected China, the state posing a sharp political and economic contrast to US. Not only did this trigger retaliatory measures but it also made the US a target of further World Trade Organisation (WTO) complaints from 9 Member States in relation to violations of the GATT articles, which promote trade liberalism. The US sought to defend itself using Article XXI’s national security exception. This article, however, purports to show that the US would not be successful in availing itself of Article XXI. The developments in the WTO Panel’s position regarding the reviewability of a nation’s measures invite greater scrutiny, posing a challenge to  US’s claim. The tariffs on steel and aluminium may be associated with a stronger national defence, hence showing an ‘essential security interest’. Furthermore, it is improbable that demonstrating a belief in the nexus between the tariffs and national defence will be a hurdle due to the low threshold of good faith. Instead, the demise of the US justification using Article XXI may be brought due to the inability of establishing that the circumstances were an ‘emergency in international relations’ and necessitated the tariffs.</p>

<h5 id="i-introduction">I) Introduction</h5>

<p>In the context of a rapidly globalising world, the increase in protectionist measures, including trade barriers, by nations acting independently is a step backwards and indeed “the last thing the global economy needs”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> The current era is marked distinctly by economic competition between the two largest economies of the world, the US and China. The anti-multilateral trade policy actions became evident right after President Trump took office and announced the withdrawal of the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> However, the most blatantly protectionist measure, the subject of this article, were the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. In 2018, Trump announced that a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium would be implemented on imports from various nations including China. This was enacted using an obscure provision in US domestic law, and the breach of the international prohibition on trade restricting measures was justified on grounds of national security.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> The American claim was that the strategic importance of steel and aluminium rendered the enforcing of tariffs crucial so that the domestic production losses were minimised and capability for supporting national industry of the metals was adequately developed for national defence and military purposes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<p>US tariffs against China caused turbulence in international trade law due to breaching the Most Favoured Nation principle of GATT Article I, according to which countries are not permitted to discriminate between their trading partners.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> As the US and China are party to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a lower or higher tariff must be applied to imports originating from all Member States without differentiation. Therefore, in order to enact a tariff, the Trump administration invoked the strict, seldom-used national security exception of Article XXI and asserted that the context was a time of ‘emergency in international relations’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> This gave rise to the question of whether the national security exception could be utilised by the US, where the crisis does not occur in the context of a conventional military conflict.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> This article seeks to demonstrate the difficulty of applying the national security exception to defend US tariffs on China within the WTO ambit of rules. The article begins by exploring the text of Article XXI and observing the impact of the Russia-Ukraine dispute on the reviewability of the US-China assertions in subjecting the dispute to greater scrutiny. It contends that although the national security exception is narrow and largely within Member State discretion, it allows for non-military, economic situations to fulfil the ‘essential security interest’ requirement. Establishing a connection between the rationale behind the measure and the essential security interest is a grey area of ascertaining the true state intention, but this problem is swiftly overcome by the low threshold of only requiring good faith action by the Member. The specific case of the US steel and aluminium tariffs may, however, fall short of demonstrating the seriousness of tensions and thus, a real ‘emergency’. Hence, it would not be covered by Article XXI, leading either to a lose-lose decision by the WTO Panel, which weakens the WTO regime, or an unrewarding settlement.</p>

<h5 id="ii-text-of-article-xxi-and-reviewability">II) Text of Article XXI and Reviewability</h5>

<p>Article XXI of GATT reads as follows:</p>

<p>Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed</p>

<p>a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or</p>

<p>b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests</p>

<p>i. relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;</p>

<p>ii. relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment;</p>

<p>iii. taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or</p>

<p>c) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<p>Article XXI was drafted with an intention to balance various interests. It aimed to “take care of real security interests and, at the same time … limit the exception so as to prevent the adoption of protection for maintaining industries under every conceivable circumstance”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> It is a product of the desire to give countries enough leeway to institute measures required for security reasons and simultaneously prevent them from abusing Article XXI for advancing commercial ambitions. As such, the US tariffs bring discomfort among officials, because it appears to mix the “politics of international disputes into the legal world of trade and business” under the camouflage of national security.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a></p>

<p>Until April 2019, many contested and unclarified sections of Article XXI, such as reviewability, remained opaque due to its limited jurisprudence. Till then, only one Panel report had been adopted out of the seven GATT disputes regarding the security exception and the three WTO disputes which were all settled.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> On 5 April 2019, the WTO issued its first ruling, a binding decision, on the national security exception and clarified the institution’s stance on the reviewability of the exception. The dispute arose between Russia and Ukraine due to measures taken by Russia which compelled transport going from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to follow specific routes. These were subject to additional conditions and obtaining derogations from authorities, thus constituting complete bans.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Ukraine complained about the breaches of GATT obligation and Russia replied by stating that the action was necessary for protecting its essential security interests. Russia’s assertion was that the Crimean events of 2014 amounted to an ‘emergency in international relations’ and threatened Russian border security. Furthermore, Russia contended that Article XXI(b)(iii) fell entirely within a Member’s remit to judge and that the WTO Panel may only acknowledge the invoking of the national security exception without examining the merits of the claim.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> This perception of Article XXI(b)(iii) as ‘non-justiciable’ has historically been shared by the US, which has publicly stated its opposition to reviewability, and it was argued that a Member should not be prohibited from acting in a manner that it perceives as necessary for the protection of its essential interests. </p>

<p>The WTO Panel disagreed with the Russian perspective on reviewability. It clarified that the WTO Panel may review actions under the security exception of Article XXI(b) and that it was objectively discernible whether one of the three subparagraphs of (b) had occurred. Moreover, the ruling stated that the Panel could also review the measure itself to assess if it was truly believed that the measure was necessary for the safeguarding of the essential security interest and if the measure and the security interest are plausibly related.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>  The only assessment that rested entirely in Members’ hands and would not be objectively reviewed by the WTO was the determination of the ‘necessity’ of the measure employed for achieving national security interests. The reason the WTO decided largely in favour of reviewability was in light of the logical structure of Article XXI(b). It was interpreted that the structure of this subsection was intended to limit Member State discretion in invoking the exceptions. If the assessment as to whether the requirements of the subsection were fulfilled were left to Members, the clauses would be stripped of any practical effect.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> In addition, it would result in Members being able to unilaterally discontinue their obligations under the GATT treaty, which would leave the impacted states unprotected and contradict the aim of WTO law to “promote the security and predictability” in trade agreements.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> These ground-breaking findings, however, may be amended or overturned if either Russia or Ukraine appealed to the Appellate Body.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a></p>

<p>The rejection of the Russian and the US position on (un)reviewability could endanger the viability of the US claim of national security in justifying tariffs, because the ruling invites greater WTO scrutiny on the measures: their necessity and the plausibility of its link with national security interests.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> The ruling reduces the possibility of exploiting the national security exception where the links between an essential security interest and the trade restriction are tenuous, or where the context or rationale is a non-emergency.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> An entirely deferential approach to the national security exception would have also contradicted the historic search for an equilibrium between protecting security interests and preventing Members from maintaining their own industries in all circumstances. This ruling prevents Members from easily deviating from the GATT commitments and it ensures that the provision does not automatically permit everything under the sun whenever it is branded as being necessary to protect an essential national interest.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a></p>

<p>As the national security exception would be closely reviewed, Article XXI(b)(iii) is no longer a wildcard that could be used by nations to circumvent trade law obligations. The next part of the paper seeks to analyse if US tariffs would survive WTO’s extensive review and whether their measure could tenably be justified on the ground of national security.</p>

<h5 id="ii-applying-the-national-security-exception">II) Applying the National Security Exception</h5>

<h6 id="a-essential-security-interest"><u>A) 'Essential Security Interest'</u></h6>

<p>The first aspect of the legal test under article XXI is whether there was an essential security interest at stake.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>In the determination of whether there was an essential interest at stake, Members are afforded a large margin of appreciation. An essential security interest is an inherently stricter requirement than ‘security interests’ alone and is said to refer to “quintessential functions of the state, namely, the protection of its territory and its population from external threats, and the maintenance of law and public order internally”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> In past national security disputes, it has been contended on numerous occasions that “every country must be the judge in the last resort on questions relating to its own security”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> and that “each contracting party was the sole judge of what was necessary in its essential security interest”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> This is hardly surprising given that the text of Article XXI states that it does not prevent Members from taking action ‘which it considers’ necessary, thus highlighting the subjective nature of this assessment. The stated interest could range from government employee benefits, effective transportation of imports and exports or development of nuclear forces.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> Therefore, a country has wide discretion to identify its essential security interests.</p>

<p>In the context of the the US-China trade war, the US articulated that the essential security interest threatened by steel and aluminium imports from China was national defence.  It was officially stated that the quantity of steel and aluminium imports threatened domestic production sites with closures and was reducing national capacity to independently produce steel and aluminium items if a national defence emergency took place.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Additionally, the tariffs were imposed to encourage the preservation of the vital skills in the US economy and labour force. </p>

<p>Given the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in assessing whether their national security interest is threatened, it is unquestionable that the US has the discretion to state that national defence is an essential security interest. However, the more difficult question is how the state discretion is tempered, and in particular, whether the concept of an ‘essential security interest’ can sufficiently accommodate non-military and commercial situations within the intentions of the GATT drafters.</p>

<p>Jaemin Lee argues that both ‘essential security interest’ and ‘emergency in international relations’ are sufficiently wide to encompass non-military and commercial or economic circumstances; however, the mere reference or highlighting of economic harm does not suffice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> As historian Paul Kennedy stated:</p>

<p>“[T]he definition of national security cannot refer simply to military policies or to military spending alone. I think it ought to refer instead to those sources, those underpinnings of long-term national strength in the state and power of our manufacturing, investment in science and technology, of educational skills, all of which ultimately the Armed Forces and defence policy of this country have to rest upon”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a></p>

<p>The only condition is that there must be an appropriate, economic justification behind the essential security interest.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> In a case involving Sweden, many Contracting Parties were unconvinced with the Swedish contention that imports of footwear threatened national defence because Sweden did not provide any detailed economic justification.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> In contrast, as the American notion of national security has historically been connected with maintaining a powerful national economy,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> the present case is unlikely to be considered inadequately justified or too remote. High tariffs commanded strong support in the US political history and were used during the Great Depression for strengthening the national economic security and industrial strength for national defence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> The US has also maintained consistent efforts in incorporating exemptions from their agreements due to economic circumstances, for instance in the Friendship Commerce and Navigation Treaties (FCN treaties). The treaty allows for derogating from national treatment obligations in a period of economic emergency.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a>  These historical precedents once again illuminate the intertwinement of domestic economic health and national security, and explain why economic circumstances can and should fall within the ambit of ‘essential security interests’ for the US.</p>

<p>Accordingly, even if the  Panel remains unconvinced about a country’s chosen matter constituting a national security interest, the selection of national interests is the sole discretion of a country and would not be amenable to WTO review if it has been adequately articulated. As mentioned above, the stated interest could range from government employee benefits, effective transportation of imports and exports or development of nuclear forces.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a>  Thus, not only is it possible for an economic interest to be used discretionarily to constitute an essential security interest, but the current case of US-China also demonstrates the economic importance and relation of steel and aluminium imports to its essential security interest.</p>

<h6 id="b-belief-in-the-measure-adopted"><u>B) Belief in The Measure Adopted</u></h6>

<p>The second aspect of the legal test involves ensuring a link between the measure adopted and the essential security interest. While the test of necessity of the measure is the exclusive assessment of a Member State, the Panel may investigate and ensure that the trade measure was taken with the sole rationale of promoting the essential interest. That said, Article XXI(b) requires adequate explanation which can be subject for review by the Panel only to observe if there is sufficient support of the measure being genuinely considered to promote the essential security interest. The test is thus reduced to a looser, good faith obligation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a>  In the case of the US, it would have to demonstrate that the tariffs do not have an ‘implausible’ relation with protecting the essential security interest of national defence and provide adequate reasoning to satisfy the necessity qualification.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a></p>

<p>As Article XXI did not specify a formal condition to satisfy the legal test and only a minimum requirement should be needed for showing connection between the measure and security interest,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a>  the US is unlikely to face challenges in fulfilling the lenient standard of review. The Proclamations on the introduction of steel and aluminium tariffs expressed the instrumental role played by steel and aluminium and its value for military and infrastructural purposes, which demonstrate the nation’s belief in the effectiveness of tariffs in achieving their national security interest.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a>  One may argue that the imposition of tariffs was not done out of genuine belief that it was required for national defence, as the Department of Defence acknowledged that only  3% of total domestic production of steel and aluminium is needed for military purposes and that there is no current shortage of this supply.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a>  However, because the WTO relies on Member cooperation and reciprocal trust, the concerns expressed in the White House proclamations could successfully fulfil the low good faith threshold. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the Panel’s finding in the Russia-Ukraine dispute that the Russian action was a measure genuinely taken for national security interests is in favour of finding the same for the US.  In that case, Russia had taken trade-restrictive measures which resulted in Ukraine not being able to use roads or railways, which prevented the flow of goods to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and affected the goods destined for Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a>  In light of the significant impact on its trade, Ukraine complained about the violation of the GATT treaty and the Russian Accession Protocol. However, Russia did not specifically respond to the legal arguments or factual basis for Ukraine’s complaints related to the GATT treaty nor the Russia Accession Protocol violations. In its submissions, it plainly stated that the measures were considered ‘necessary for essential security interests’ in relation to the 2014 emergency concerning the security of the Ukraine-Russia border.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a></p>

<p>Despite such little engagement with the allegations and the absence of a full defence on the Russian part, the Panel found that “Russia’s articulation of its essential security interests is minimally satisfactory”. Ultimately, the question was phrased as asking whether the measure was “so remote from, or unrelated to, the 2014 emergency that it is implausible that Russia implemented them for the protection of its essential security interest”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> On that formulation, only the most distanced and remote links between the measure and essential interest would be rejected. This indicates that even making public suggestions of enacting measures for protectionist interests would not jeopardise the country from meeting the low threshold.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> Thus, even a counterargument that Trump made public statements highlighting that the tariffs on China were for non-essential security reasons would fail to damage the US assertion of good faith belief in the measure. The low threshold would lead to US trade measures being considered as genuinely intended for facilitating national industries.  </p>

<h6 id="c-emergency-in-international-relations"><u>C) 'Emergency in International Relations'</u></h6>

<p>The final determination that Panel must make is to decide whether one of the conditions within subparagraph (b) exist, the most relevant of which for present purposes is the state of emergency in international relations. Lacking an official definition, ‘emergency in international relations’ is one of the vaguest phrases in the article and has been interpreted in ordinary language and meaning in the context of the phrase “war or other emergency in international relations”. As ‘war’ has been referred to as a “violent struggle through the application of armed force”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> the meaning of ‘emergency’ must be different to ‘war’ and need not reach the gravity of an armed military conflict or else the distinction would be futile. Nevertheless, an emergency must be sufficiently serious to ensure that every state that cannot demonstrate an armed conflict, does not simply rely on the phrase, ‘emergency’, to justify trade measures in a context of mild frictions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> The Panel in the Russia-Ukraine dispute defined an emergency in international relations as a “situation of armed conflict, or of a latent armed conflict, or of heightened tension or crisis, or of general instability engulfing or surrounding a state”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> Due to the political and military tensions after the Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014, the Panel was satisfied that the measures taken by Russia were during an emergency period, which gave rise to security concerns for the Ukraine-Russia border. Moreover, the UN General Assembly’s recognition of the armed conflict and absence of evidence suggesting an intention to circumvent WTO trade rules led the Panel to conclude that the minimum requirements for Article XXI(b) had been met.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a></p>

<p>Although ‘heightened tension or crisis’ could equate to a non-military and economic emergency, the US economic relations with China are unlikely to satisfy the ‘emergency’ requirement. In general, an economic situation, which albeit is not war but threatens causing comparable damage is capable of falling under the scope of ‘emergency’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> In fact, the use of the conjunction ‘or’ between ‘war’ and ‘emergency in international relations’ indicates that non-war emergencies can be equally harmful to domestic interests, especially in light of economic retaliation and cyber attacks.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> Therefore, it appears that non-military circumstances could validly constitute ‘emergencies’ if they reach a similar level of threat.   However, based on a comparable case, the US would be unable to prove the gravity of the US-China trade war and would, therefore, fail in proving an ‘emergency’.</p>

<p>In the arbitration proceedings of CMS against Argentina at ICSID, the emergency defence of a bilateral agreement was invoked by Argentina to justify its actions. However, even though the Argentinian economy suffered through a major economic and political crisis since the 1990s, to the extent that it enacted new laws declaring a public emergency, the tribunal found that Argentina did not meet the benchmark of ‘total’ economic collapse.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> Although the ICSID tribunals are not binding on the WTO, the ICSID interpretation of ‘emergency’ makes for an interesting and potentially useful comparison, especially because WTO has no jurisprudence of its own on this matter. Not only is the US economic situation far less precarious than the Argentinian, but the tension between the US and China remains mainly that of political and economic differences, which as per the Panel report on Russia and Ukraine is insufficient alone for showing an emergency. As the US-China trade war is not of extreme severity and section 232 was intended as an overall economic policy tool<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> instead of specifically aimed at national economic security reasons, the US-tariffs are unlikely to be considered as having arisen in an emergency context. Therefore, the US invocation of the national security exception of Article XXI is unlikely to succeed.           </p>

<h5 id="iii-outcome-of-the-dispute">III) Outcome of the Dispute</h5>

<p>Although the foregoing analysis implies that the US would have breached WTO laws and cannot make use of the national security exception, this may not necessarily lead to a WTO finding that there has been a breach. If the dispute results in a Panel decision, it could be a ‘lose-lose’ choice. On the one hand, if the Panel lowers the threshold required for an ‘emergency in international relations’ or for other reasons finds that the US could successfully apply Article XXI’s exception, the leniency could encourage other nations to implement trade barriers under the mask of ‘essential security interest’. Not only would this damage the credibility of the WTO as a neutral institution, but it would also render the trade laws that prohibit trade restrictions nugatory. On the other hand, a Panel ruling that finds against the use of the national security justification for the US would be perceived as encroaching upon national decisions and could lead to crucial players, such as the US, withdrawing their membership from the institution.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> It would also risk antagonising the US further, which already refused the replacements for the leaving members of the Appellate Body. This would mean that, unless the US began approving members, the Appellate Body would be paralysed in its functioning as it requires a minimum of three panellists and, without replacements, soon there may only be two panellists remaining.</p>

<p>Due to the unfavourable consequences of having a direct confrontation through a Panel decision, it is likely that dispute resolution is reached through diplomatic or non-confrontational means, such as the position US-Nicaragua dispute ended in. In this dispute in 1985, the US effectuated a full trade embargo on exports and imports that went to or originated from Nicaragua. Nicaragua claimed that the US had violated various articles of GATT and that the national security exception could not be used arbitrarily in a context where it was challenging to believe that a country as economically and physically small as Nicaragua posed a real threat to US essential interests.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Although a Panel report was issued, there was no consensus and the report was ultimately not adopted. Nevertheless, the trade embargo and all sanctions were officially lifted in 1990 when US officials stated that the circumstances that created the need for the trade restriction had dissipated.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> The US-China and US-Nicaragua dispute share similarities in both being cases where an essential non-military interest was at stake, an extreme trade measure was adopted and the context did not represent a true ‘emergency of international relations’. Given these commonalities, it is possible that a diplomatic or political solution may be the only acceptable outcome for the US-China dispute.   </p>

<h5 id="iv-conclusion">IV) Conclusion</h5>

<p>Overall it seems that invoking the national security exception involves a delicate balance between restricting Members from acting in protectionist manners while being permissive of deviations under the narrow condition of an endangered essential security interest. If the dispute reached the WTO Panel, the US’s use of the defence would be subject to extensive review. The essential security interest of national defence is likely to be satisfied due to Member State discretion in this field and the link between steel and aluminium and national defence. Demonstrating genuine belief in the tariffs being able to achieve a stronger national defence system would also be easily fulfilled, albeit after being subject to review, due to the low threshold. It is the final determination of whether an emergency in international relations exists which would be a blow to the US reliance on the national security exception, as this necessitates grave circumstances in the US-China trade war and the state of affairs has not yet reached that severity.</p>

<p>The handling of the US-China trade dispute highlights the weaknesses of the WTO as an institution that relies on consensus and requires the cooperation of key economic leaders in order to be effective. Thus far, the Panel decisions, or the lack thereof, have given rise to more questions than answers, such as the degree to which the Panel will continue with almost ground-level good faith requirement where a nation gives mixed indications of its true rationale behind trade restrictions. Moreover, the application of the vague definitions of ‘emergency’ will remain largely opaque until there is further jurisprudence on Article XXI. Perhaps the clearest lesson on analysing literature and applying the Russia-Ukraine ruling to the US-China tariffs is that discussions of Article XXI(b) have only commenced and require examination in various contexts before its true shape becomes workable or clear. Suffice it to say that the national security exception is no longer a trump card.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>The Pre-Trial Chamber (“PTC”) II of the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) handed down its much-awaited decision on the request for authorisation of an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> earlier this year. The escalating conflict in Afghanistan has generated thousands of civilian casualties, many of whom were also victims of acts potentially constituting war crimes within the ICC’s jurisdiction.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> The decision that the investigation would not be in the interests of justice to pursue thus came as a surprise to the legal community, given the presumed dormancy of the provision – many had thought that any admissible case would <em>ipso facto</em> be in the interests of justice to pursue. Indeed, it was widely assumed that the decision would only be subject to review by the PTC where the Office of the Prosecutor (“OTP”) had decided <em>not</em> to pursue an investigation solely in the interests of justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> This case note will analyse the role of state cooperation in the PTC’s interests of justice determination in light of the principle of complementarity, which holds that the ICC should only intervene where a State Party was “unwilling or unable”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> to investigate a crime falling under the ICC’s jurisdiction. The objectives of domestic institution-building that the principle was conceived of to foster will be considered, before concluding that the PTC’s overt focus on prosecutorial success is misguided.</p>

<h5 id="the-case">The Case</h5>

<p>The OTP submitted the request to authorise a <em>proprio motu</em> investigation into the ongoing situation in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (“Afghanistan”) in November 2017, pursuant to Article 15(3) of the Rome Statute.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> The escalating conflict in Afghanistan has raged on for almost two decades, with what started as a Taliban insurgency spreading into a guerrilla-style war drawing in actors from beyond the state’s borders, including the US and other international forces. The investigation concerned alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in the territory of Afghanistan, and was classified into three “categories” according to the different groups allegedly responsible for the crimes, namely (i) the Taliban and other armed groups, (ii) Afghan Forces, and (iii) US Forces and the CIA.</p>

<p>The PTC examined whether there was a “reasonable basis to proceed” as per Article 53(1)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> by assessing jurisdiction, admissibility, and whether it served the interests of justice to undertake the investigation. For an investigation to be admissible, it needs to meet the admissibility criteria of gravity and complementarity. The PTC, uncontroversially and in line with general academic consensus, agreed with the majority of the OTP’s arguments, going so far as to make positive determinations on both the jurisdiction and admissibility requirements – only to subsequently deem that there were “substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>The PTC proceeded to list three factors considered in arriving at the determination: (1) significant time elapsed between alleged crimes and the Request, (2) scarce cooperation obtained by OTP, and (3) accessibility of relevant evidence and potential relevant suspects to the investigation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> In relation to factors 1 and 3, the PTC cited the long preliminary examination, the lack of action towards the preservation of evidence, and the worsening political situation in Afghanistan complicating the process of obtaining evidence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> On the issue of scarce state cooperation, which is the main focus for the purposes of this note, it was deemed that changes within the political landscape in Afghanistan and key States made it “difficult to gauge the prospects of securing meaningful cooperation from relevant authorities for the future”. In particular, the OTP’s “difficulties in securing albeit minimal cooperation from the relevant authorities” were noted.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a></p>

<p>The above factors were said to “possibly compromis[e] [the OTP’s] chances for success”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> As such, the PTC was of the opinion that “the prospects for a successful investigation and prosecution [were] extremely limited”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> It was postulated that the failure of such an investigation could in turn create “frustration and possibly hostility vis-à-vis the Court”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> negatively impacting the ICC’s ability to credibly pursue the objectives it was created to serve. Such was the reasoning that ultimately led to the conclusion that it would not be in the interests of justice to pursue the investigation.</p>

<p>Questionable points of law could be raised concerning the PTC’s treatment of state cooperation in relation to the principle of complementarity, and the wide interpretation of the interests of justice provision to equate it with the institutional preservation of the ICC.</p>

<h5 id="state-cooperation-and-complementarity">State Cooperation and Complementarity</h5>

<p>The extent of state cooperation (or lack thereof) is apparent from the OTP’s preliminary examinations, and reflects varying levels of willingness to cooperate according to the “category” that was being pursued. As regards Taliban forces, the OTP noted efforts taken by the Afghan government to “build its capacity to meet its obligations under the Rome Statute” and to “facilitate national investigations and prosecutions of ICC crimes”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Among these efforts included the update of the country’s Criminal Procedure Code, and a new Penal Code Bill incorporating Rome Statute crimes and specifying superior responsibility.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Afghan authorities showed more restraint in proceedings against members of the Afghan Forces. Whilst a “limited number” of proceedings had been instituted, all cases were eventually dismissed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Although the national proceedings have been found to be insufficient, there is little to indicate that authorities would have shown resistance to cooperation if the case were brought to the international plane, given previous co-operation with other international bodies including the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> and UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a></p>

<p>In a contrasting vein, reports concerning the willingness of US authorities to cooperate are a vastly different matter. From the outset, the OTP stated that specific information on national proceedings were sought from US authorities but “not receive[d]”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> leaving it unable to obtain sufficient information “despite a number of efforts taken”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> The OTP thus had to rely on publicly available information contained in open sources on which to base its report. A common theme of US obstinacy was notable throughout the OTP’s assessment. This included CAT observations that the US provided “minimal statistics” and insufficient information leading to an inability to assess compliance,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a>  and the delay of a Polish Prosecutor General’s investigation into a CIA detention facility on its territory due to “a lack of US Government cooperation”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a>  Indeed, it appears that the PTC’s references to the difficulty in seeking the cooperation of “relevant authorities”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a>  was its implicit and diplomatic way of referring to US authorities.</p>

<p>In and of itself, the decision to factor in a state’s willingness to cooperate with ICC investigators is already dubious, insofar as it is a consideration of extra-legal and prudential factors.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a>  Seen through the lens of complementarity, however, the decision could arguably be said to turn everything the ICC was founded to stand for on its head. The principle of complementarity was a founding cornerstone<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a>  of the Rome Statute, giving states primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute core international crimes. The OTP has largely taken a “positive” approach to complementarity, taking the stance that not only should State Parties retain this primary responsibility, but that they should be encouraged, or induced, to do so where possible. An ethos of domestic accountability and capacity-building is thus emphasised in the ICC’s fight against impunity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a>  However, the decision not to authorise an investigation on the basis of lack of state cooperation – in other words, accountability – not only excuses such behaviour, but <em>encourages</em> such behaviour.</p>

<p>As a “court of last resort”, it is the <em>raison d’être</em> of the ICC to be able to extend its reach where others cannot. This notion is seen in many features of the court, such as its potential for universal jurisdiction<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a>  or its ability to override immunity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> Complementarity can be conceived of as a spectrum – with governments that are willing and able on one end, and governments that are significantly unwilling or unable on the other. It is at this further end where the larger proportion of impunity gaps would have existed pre-ICC.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a></p>

<p>It is this amalgamation of factors that makes trying difficult cases – that is, cases which might prove difficult to investigate due to absence of state cooperation – inherent to the role of the ICC. When following the doctrine of command responsibility or dealing with officials with immunity, the individual in question is almost always going to have a certain level of authority within the state. The principle of complementarity meanwhile filters cases such that the admissibility of an investigation is predicated on there having been a minimum level of domestic resistance to delivering justice. Oftentimes, the impunity normally is so grave that is goes to the very heart of the state’s exercise of sovereign prerogatives,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> and it is this quality that warrants the domestic extrication of the case and its elevation to the international fora. All factors considered, this leaves the ICC in a position where state cooperation is hard to come by. Lack of state cooperation unfortunately is part and parcel of the job.</p>

<p>In the context of this case, a third new level of state cooperation which determines whether an investigation will proceed has been created. The first is where a state is cooperative such that initiative is taken to undertake sufficient domestic proceedings. Such investigations will be deemed inadmissible for reasons of complementarity and the case tried domestically. The second is where it is domestically deficient, but cooperates internationally. The domestic deficiency is necessary for a positive determination of admissibility, and proceedings are brought before the ICC. These two constitute the traditional complementarity binary. The Afghanistan case has introduced a third layer, where the state is domestically deficient and refuses to cooperate internationally, so much so that it goes beyond legal questions of complementarity and admissibility, and it is deemed “not in the interests of justice” to proceed with the investigation.</p>

<p>This setback for promoting accountability and capacity-building in domestic institutions is two-fold because of the cooperation of the Afghan government. This is particularly so in relation to allegations against Taliban Forces, with authorities having made efforts to build its capacity to facilitate prosecutions. Where in other cases the ICC had taken the opportunity to engage constructively,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> in the present case they have washed their hands of the situation, whilst simultaneously rewarding the US for its obstructive ways.</p>

<p>In this context, the determination on interests of justice functions as the anti-complementarity provision, stipulating that it is acceptable not to cooperate with investigations even if a state seeks to avoid standing before the ICC, as long as they are sufficiently uncooperative so that an investigation is not in the “interests of justice”. In other instances, complementarity is “intended to preserve the ICC’s power over irresponsible states that refuse to prosecute those who commit heinous crimes”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> and it is against that refusal that the ICC carries on its fight against impunity. The fluidity with which a lack of state cooperation can be construed to fit into either of these narratives is a dangerous tool of unfettered discretion. Given previous similar instances involving other recalcitrant states,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a>  it is hard to defend against accusations of US exceptionalism, and the Courts need to be wary of the danger of it becoming a “one rule for them, another for us” situation.</p>

<p>Besides the danger it poses for the legitimacy of the ICC, the practical implications of factoring state cooperation into decisions are extensive as well. The lack of cooperation from national authorities in the ICTY trials provides a glimpse into potential repercussions, such as the confinement of successful cases to that of low-ranking officials.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a>  Further, more cases are likely to be tried <em>ex post facto</em>, after the criminal incidents have come to a conclusion and normally as a product of regime change when authorities begin to cooperate, as was the case in Serbia,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> which means the ICC might have a limited ability to make an actual difference to the situation whilst it is ongoing.</p>

<h5 id="successful-investigations-in-the-interests-of-justice">Successful Investigations: In the Interests of Justice?</h5>

<p>Of course, in the examples drawn from the ICTY, the relevant individuals already had cases brought against them, so the reality is that the presence of an investigation made little practical difference. Even if the Afghanistan investigation had been authorised, it would have been doomed to failure from lack of state cooperation. This is the utilitarian argument the PTC employ – since the consequences would be the same anyhow, resources should be conserved and efforts should be focussed on successful prosecutions. This approach provides relief to the ICC’s tattered reputation,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a>  and perhaps instils better hope for its continued institutional functioning, given the criticism received from delayed investigations and the fact that the ICC has only ever produced three convictions that have survived appellate review.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a>  Alongside political threats levelled by US authorities,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a>  there was the overwhelming sense that this was simply not a battle that the ICC had the wherewithal to face:</p>

<p>“[T]he Court is not meant - or equipped - to address any and all scenarios where the most serious international crimes might have been committed; therefore, focussing on those scenarios where the prospects for successful and meaningful investigations are serious and substantive is key to its ultimate success.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a></p>

<p>However, even if makes no <em>practical</em> difference to the outcome, to refuse to authorise the investigation would be to <em>legally</em> permit the outcome. The concept of the ICC was founded on the idea of a body which upholds a set of fundamental norms by punishing certain jus cogens wrongs which shock the global conscience of mankind.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> This normative flavour in theory presupposes leaving no room for derogation, yet the decision not to authorise an investigation on the basis of prudential reasons overrides the moral imperative underlying the norms in question. In doing this, the ICC has lost its status as signaller of international normative standards to states. Not too long ago was it claimed that the most serious situations are chosen<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> for investigation, so as to make examples<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> and fulfil the Court’s didactic legalist function. Such endeavours have now been sacrificed on the altar of its newfound focus on “successful” investigations, under the guise of interests of justice.</p>

<p>Yet despite its wide construction of the interests of justice provision, the PTC has taken a rather narrow view of what justice could entail. The ICC’s overarching objective of the “effective prosecution of the most serious international crimes, the fight against impunity and the prevention of mass atrocities”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> was relied upon to justify the prioritisation of state compliance. To reduce justice to the continued existence of the ICC, and by extension a mere quantum of successful investigations, is misguided. The problem here is the conflation of compliance with effectiveness,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> in assuming that the ICC would be most effectively able to uphold the norms it espouses through higher levels of state compliance. In reality, the concept of justice reaches much further than the bounds of the ICC as an institution, and relinquishing this institutional egocentrism might allow for the realisation of justice on a wider level.</p>

<p>The traditional Austinian view which sees the ICC as only as powerful as its coercive power is perhaps lacking, and a wider view takes into account its political influence on state behaviour. The principle of complementarity serves as a humble reminder of this, and coupled with the ICC’s norm-signalling function, encourages the pursuit of justice on a national level and leaves the ICC as a court of last resort. As the OTP once remarked: “As a consequence of complementarity the number of cases that reach the court should not be a measure of its efficiency. On the contrary, the absence of trials before this court, as a consequence of the regular functioning of national institutions, would be a major success.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> Perhaps the greatest irony lies in the fact that the attainment of the ICC’s core objective might be best achieved in a world where it has little need to be employed.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>The interests of justice determination in the PTC’s Afghanistan ruling seemed a knee-jerk ruling seeking the institutional preservation of the ICC, in response to the existential threat to the ICC’s authority posed by US authorities. However, it is intrinsic to the role of the ICC and its fight against impunity to have to preside over difficult cases, oftentimes involving little state cooperation. As such, investigatory or prosecutorial failure might prove to be more common than success. The answer is not to altogether forego investigating such cases, and in doing so abandon long-standing legal principles like complementarity. Continuing down this idealistic path might strike one as a trade-off between global standard-setting and ICC potency. However, it is preferable that the Court continues to aspire towards concrete global normative standards of justice, even if it potentially means recurring institutional failure, than to achieve standards that fall below what ought to be aspired towards in the first instance. To do the latter might well prove to be a pyrrhic victory.</p>
