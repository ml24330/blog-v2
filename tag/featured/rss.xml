	     <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>The area of contract interpretation has been heavily discussed in light of the Court’s seemingly conflicting case law on the shift towards the contextual approach. In particular, several commentators have wondered if the courts have taken a step back towards the traditional, textual approach after making giant strides towards contextualism.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> This essay shall seek to unify the conflicting case law on contract interpretation under a single, coherent theory of ‘individualisation’. Such a theory will illustrate that the court’s recent judgments have focused on enhancing the ‘freedom’ of the individual in achieving their own particular interpretation of the contract. While this article’s scope does not address how the ‘individualisation’ theory applies to all other doctrines of contract law, individualisation still rests on general liberal principles, which should serve as a good starting point for analysing the other doctrines. The article shall thus narrow its focus to only discuss individualisation within the context of interpretation. </p>

<h4 id="a-grand-theory-of-contract-law">A (Grand) Theory of Contract Law?</h4>

<p>Before the article can proceed with discussion of the recent case law on contract interpretation, it will briefly discuss general theories of contract law. History begins not with a particular theory, but the oft-cited doctrine of ‘freedom of contract’. Central to the idea of freedom of contract was individual autonomy and its promotion through the realm of contract law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> Free from interference by the courts and the government, contract law merely serves as the ‘vehicle’ for the courts to enforce contracts as the parties had intended.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> This distinctly liberal concept of contract law continues to pervade English jurisprudence, despite its supposed decline since the early 20^th^ century.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Meanwhile, liberalism became the predominant mode of contract law theories, and in 1981, Charles Fried published his seminal work <em>Contract as Promise</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a>in defence of a liberal contract law. Here, Fried’s theory will serve as an excellent starting point for analysis given its preeminent status as a modern defence of liberalism in contract law, and importantly because it couches contract law within the realm of morality. This can be contrasted with other, more practical theories of contract<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> which may lack sufficient normative strength in justifying the operation of contract law. Given the article’s intention to propose a unifying theory of contract interpretation based on liberal principles, it would also be helpful to examine the value of liberal theories through Fried’s work.</p>

<p>To understand the significance of Fried’s theory, we must first distinguish between ‘foundationalist’ and ‘conventionalist’ theories of contract law. Saprai provides an excellent summary of the key differences: the former “presupposes a deontological moral outlook as a mode of justifying” contract law; while the latter serves “purely epistemic” ends and is more descriptive of contract law so as to make it more “digestible, predictable” and practicable.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each school, it should be noted that the theory this article proposes will not simply be a descriptive and ‘epistemic’ theory, and instead intends to justify <em>why </em>the courts have chosen to develop the doctrine of interpretation in the manner they did. Regardless, the advantage of foundationalist theories is that they enhance the legitimacy of the operation of contract law doctrines by grounding them within a single principle, while conventionalist theories merely see contract law as an “arbitrary collection of doctrines”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> Foundationalism also brings greater unity, as well as coherence to contract law and can help in predicting future developments of contract law (assuming that the theory is accurate).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Lastly, as a <em>standard of justification </em>for contract law doctrines, it sets clear limits to the powers of the court when furthering the development of contract law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> While conventionalist theories may be more practical insofar as they are able to better account for inconsistencies within the Court’s approach, it is only because they accept developments of the law as matters of fact and do not critically analyse the Court’s jurisprudence. They can thus barely be called ‘theories’ of contract law.</p>

<p>Moving on to Fried, he proposes the idea of ‘promise’ as the foundational concept of contract law. Thus, promise transcends all communitarian understandings of contract law, and contract law <em>ought</em> to affirm promise because it is the basis by which individuals as “free and autonomous agents both serve their own ends and respect the humanity of other free autonomous agents”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Its key contribution to theories of contract law is therefore its respect of the “liberal ideal”, that any and all action must have some “terms and limits according to which we strive”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> This provides a powerful basis for both justifying, as well as limiting the development of contract law. Given this, how would the theory function in practice? Saprai states that ‘promise’ as a foundationalist theory must operate in one of three ways: (1) as a necessity in any contract law doctrine (necessity); (2) as the primary principle behind doctrines (primacy); or (3) as a presumption of the validity of doctrines (presumptiveness).[<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> In summary, the first two suggestions can be <em>prima facie</em> rejected due to their incompatibility with modern contract law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> It is clear that not all contract law doctrines are justified based on the sanctity of promises, and to hold so would be to inaccurately describe the justifications behind such doctrines. Presumptiveness however, is more difficult to reject from the outset. It minimally recognises the existence as well as primacy of other principles, but still acts as the central principle justifying contract law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Yet, even such an accommodating perspective of promise fails to account properly for the actual relevance of other principles such as justice and fairness, which take centre stage in doctrines where promise plays little to no part (such as statutory implied terms). Since presumptions are inherently epistemic, i.e., that all doctrines should converge with the principle unless justified otherwise, it again serves as the first barrier of contract law doctrines when there is no reason to subsume them under promise in the first place.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> It is thus doubly undesirable: (1) it is a weaker form of primacy, failing to truly elevate promise as <em>the</em> principle of contract law; and (2) does not accord proper respect to alternative deontic principles of contract law.</p>

<p>Further criticism of Fried’s theory takes the form of practicability and functionality. Kostritsky argues that the promise theory, naturally being deontological, removes itself from the normative aspects of contract law – the purpose and reasons for the system of contracting, and why it is so valued in society.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> The theory ultimately fails to account for an “understanding of the [contracting] parties’ goals” and is unable to “craft rules which will work in reality”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> However, given that the theory was not meant to be epistemic in nature, is the exclusion of contract’s functional role justified? As stated above, Fried’s theory is able to transcend communitarian understandings of contract law doctrines, and therefore protects contract law from arbitrariness and the majoritarian will (and <em>abuse</em>) of the community.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Despite this, the theory still lacks normative pull given that <em>other </em>principles of contract law also aim to protect contract law from arbitrariness and majoritarian abuse; failing to recognise the plurality of these other principles also harms its credibility as a theory. Moreover, promise’s weight as a moral justification is arguably lacking – beyond literal <em>pacta sunt servanda</em>, promises hold little moral strength and fall flat in their attempt to justify judicial enforcement (or lack thereof).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> As has often been argued, autonomy does not simply mean non-interference, but also extends to the ability to choose freely from amongst many valid choices (including the ability to exit unfavourable circumstances).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<h4 id="promise-theory-an-alternative">Promise Theory: An Alternative?</h4>

<p>Given the above conclusions, are there any competing theories that may bridge the lacunae identified in Fried’s promise theory? How might the significance of foundationalist theories be maintained while accommodating for the functional and pluralist nature of other contract law theories? For this, we look no further than Saprai’s third understanding of promise theory: presumptiveness. While presumptiveness was earlier rejected, it nonetheless has redeeming qualities in its recognition of alternative deontological principles, and thus normative pluralism.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> Yet, it is not as simple as proposing a pluralist theory of contract law which recognises all principles equally. After all, much of the work the judiciary does is balancing between multiple competing rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> One possible solution comes from Saprai, who offers a completely new theory of contract law termed ‘republican contract law’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> It thus emphasises the plurality of presumptiveness through a distinctly Dworkinian approach which creates a law that is essentially by the people, and for the people; through incorporating “popular views” regarding morality, limits, and purpose of the law, into the law itself.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> The theory goes beyond conventionalist theories because it is not merely an “epistemic device” which reflects what the law does, but builds the specific communitarian conception of the law into its deontology – making it the very “fabric of law”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> While this open-endedness may lead to uncertainty and indeterminacy of legal standards, such uncertainties are balanced by individuals having a greater understanding of how the law shapes and affects their lives, thereby creating a deeper connection between themselves and the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a></p>

<p>Given the ambitious nature of the theory, there is obviously much room to doubt whether it can actually achieve the lofty goals it has set out to accomplish. In fact, flaws can already be seen through an analysis of the theory’s unique conception of freedom as ‘non-domination’. A comprehensive account of what such freedom entails is provided by Pettit, who describes freedom as the characteristic of not being subject to the arbitrary will of others (as opposed to classical freedom as non-interference).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> The true extent of this freedom is its reach – it goes beyond preventing exercises of arbitrary will and attempts to remove the existence of such arbitrariness completely.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Non-domination thus harkens back to the crux of the republican theory – to treat all individuals with equal concern and respect. Saprai states that one particular threat to non-domination is that of <em>dominium</em>, or being subject to the arbitrary will of individuals or individual entities; and that contract law can contribute to the creation of <em>dominium</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> Despite his claims that a republican theory can prevent <em>dominium</em>, the self-contradictory nature of the theory is already apparent. While Saprai is confident that his theory “shows equal concern and respect” to individuals,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> he seems to forget that any communitarian understanding is made up of both majoritarian and minoritarian components. As a theory that incorporates abstract notions such as morality and justice into the law,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> the theory must necessarily incorporate majoritarian understandings of such abstractions if it is to be practicable and coherent. The framework thus facilitates the inequality, subjugation and control that the theory seeks to eliminate. If it were to attempt to generate a more comprehensive understanding by incorporating minoritarian understandings, it would lose its practicability due to the increase in complexity needed to express a fully comprehensive understanding of societal values – it simply is an impossible task to achieve. Indeed, the plurality which the theory achieves is simply a majoritarian plurality which excludes all other possible values; a plurality that is illusory at best.</p>

<p>This article therefore suggests that while the republican theory believes its strength to be its ability to engage greater participation in the shaping and understanding of the law (as mentioned above), its real strength is the value and dignity it accords to individuals.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> The true value of liberal theories is not the promotion of one particular conception of freedom, but the ability to freely pursue one’s own conception of liberal values (i.e., self-realised values).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> Even something as widely respected as autonomy is valuable insofar as it is “exercised in the pursuit of…valuable activities and relationships”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> This article therefore proposes that a scoping down of the republican theory into an ‘individualisation’ theory achieves this. Individualisation is simply a theory which recognises that the principle behind contract law is that of promoting and upholding the individual’s right to self-realisation. Historically, individualism has been part of liberal contract theories since the very days of classical freedom of contract, and so it is not an unfamiliar concept to contract law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> Moreover, it is the focus on the individual which was the key procedural aspect of Dworkin’s theory.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> By removing the need to incorporate popular views about morality, rights and other abstractions, and focusing merely on promotion of individual understandings of such concepts, the plurality of values is retained while removing the framework that necessarily promotes instances of abuse and arbitrariness.</p>

<p>Two points need to be addressed here. Firstly, one might worry that individualisation would lead to instability – after all, if we recognised all individual conceptions as equal, it would lead to endless conflict and unresolvable disputes. However, it is not us, but arbitrators of the law (i.e. the judiciary) who determine which individual conception would take priority over another, <em>assuming</em> that such conceptions are contradictory. In reality, contracting does not always result in conflicting interpretations, but rather compromise and mutual agreement; it is however, pertinent to address worst-case scenarios and problems with competing interpretations (individualisation is ultimately a pluralist theory at heart). What this means in practice is that the specific individual conception that is accepted by the court will only be valid in the specific circumstance in which it was raised, thus preventing one particular conception from defeating all others.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> It has little standing nor influence outside of its own unique circumstance, and so each interpretation has limited (but not no) precedential value.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> On a related note, a second issue arises: if individual conceptions have no ‘longevity’, who would trust the judicial system, and by extension, the legal order? Arguably, trust is ensured because the deontological role of the individual allows all viewpoints to obtain presumptive equality and value until proven otherwise. What this means is not that every person is essentially ‘correct’ until disproven in a court of law, but that all individuals possess the freedom to argue that their specific conception should be accepted by the majority. The trust is therefore placed in the fact that such freedoms will always be upheld in a court of law. Moreover, any arguments arising from conflicting conceptions will be dealt with <em>objectively </em>by the judiciary, thus preventing <em>arbitrary</em> subjection of the ‘losing’ individual (and it shall be shown that the court indeed has adopted such an approach). This follows a late-Rawlsian approach where “individuals are allowed to determine their own conception of the good”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> and where the government and the law remain fairly value-neutral insofar as they do not explicitly incorporate a specific understanding into the legal system.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> It is this which allows a departure from the ambitiousness of the republican theory, while retaining the pluralist appeal of modern liberalism.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> Individualisation is thus a hybrid-theory that takes advantage of the republican theory’s focus on freedom, while placing the individual, rather than their<em> collective</em> <em>understandings</em>, as the foundation of contract law. While it lacks certainty in application, such uncertainty can be tolerated given the normative value of the theory.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a></p>

<h4 id="individualisation-in-interpretation">Individualisation in Interpretation</h4>

<p>In applying the individualisation theory to the doctrine of contract interpretation, there can be no better case than <em>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v West Bromwich Building Society</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a>(<em>ICS</em>), and the contextual approach set out by Lord Hoffmann. The approach can be summarised below:</p>

<p>Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a></p>

<p>This distinct departure from the textual approach (for example in <em>Arnold v Britton </em>(<em>Arnold</em>)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a>) has arguably been the most significant development to the doctrine of interpretation in recent time. <em>ICS</em> should be seen alongside a string of other cases (starting from <em>Prenn v Simmons</em>;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> with the most recent example being <em>Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a>) which fully cemented the position of the contextual approach as the predominant approach towards contract interpretation. The approach taken by Lord Hoffmann contains two limbs, both of which shall be shown to adhere with the individualisation theory: (1) taking into account the “background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties”; (2) the objective meaning of the text.</p>

<p>Beginning first with the background knowledge component, the full contours and limits of the contextual approach must be addressed. The relevant cases are that of <em>BCCI v Ali</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a>and <em>Arnold v Britton</em>. In <em>BCCI v Ali</em>, Lord Bingham qualified the contextual approach by saying that it can only be exercised within the limits of the “natural and ordinary meaning” of the contract’s wording.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> This echoes the words of Lord Neuberger in <em>Arnold</em>, who emphasised the textual limitation of the contextual approach, stating that “commercial common sense and surrounding circumstances […] should not be invoked to undervalue the importance of the language of the provision”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> In contrast, Lord Hoffmann chose instead to limit the background knowledge to what the “reasonable man would have regarded as <em>relevant</em> [sic]”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> Despite the above cases’ apparent disagreement with <em>ICS</em>, the individualisation theory still reveals itself in both the shift towards the contextual approach, as well as the limitations set on it. This is achieved through two different methods of enhancing individual freedoms. In the shift towards the contextual approach, the understanding and respect of the ‘specific’ individual is enhanced – the Court allowed interpretation to take into account the necessary knowledge needed to situate the individual within his unique circumstance, leading to a deeper level of understanding of that individual’s own conception of liberty. Additionally, the emphasis on the textual limitation, as well as Hoffmann’s ‘reasonable person’ limitation strengthens both the ‘collective’ individual and ‘specific’ individual. Firstly, it sets <em>reasonable </em>limitations to the doctrine of background knowledge – by qualifying the operation of the possibly wide doctrine with the certain existence of the contractual language, the freedom (in the late-Rawlsian sense) of the collective individual is enhanced by preventing arbitrariness. Secondly, it enhances the freedom of the particular parties of the case by limiting interpretation to the exact words they had agreed upon, thus respecting their ‘term freedom’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a></p>

<p>Subsequently, the objective understanding of the text (as affirmed by <em>Scottish Power UK Plc v BP Exploration Operating Co Ltd</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a>) also complies with the individualisation theory. This is relatively straightforward, and the only aspect that needs to be addressed is the trade-off between enhancing the ‘specific’ or ‘collective’ individual. Given the binary nature of litigation, the objective approach to understanding results in an asymmetric balance between one specific individual’s freedom being narrowed, and one specific individual’s freedom being broadened. However, objectivity as explained above leads to the strengthening of the collective individual – the only question that need be answered then is whether the narrowed freedom of the specific individual can outweigh the enhanced freedom of both the collective, and another specific individual. There can be no definitive answer to this, but it would be reasonable to conclude that consistent application of the objective approach will more likely result in overall enhancement of freedoms, so long as the standard of objectivity is one of reasonableness.</p>

<p>Finally, the elephant in the room shall be addressed – that of the exclusion of pre-contractual negotiations in background knowledge. This exclusion was affirmed by Lord Hoffmann himself in <em>Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd</em> (<em>Chartbrook</em>)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> where he emphasised the need for certainty and predictability when determining what comprises relevant background knowledge. This is arguably a difficult development to fit within the scope of individualisation. Normatively, pre-contractual negotiations are not more indeterminate than concepts such as “commercial common sense” or what a “reasonable man would have regarded as relevant”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> While Lord Hoffmann did identify that allowing pre-contractual negotiations may pose a risk to third-parties, such evidence was inconclusive to warrant a definitive basis for exclusion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> Nonetheless, even if such a rule did have the effect of contradicting the individualisation theory, its scope was nonetheless narrowed to only apply within the context of interpretation, and could see possible use in other doctrines of contract law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> While this does not fully resolve the problem, Ogilvie contends that doing so would at least weaken the effect of the rule by subsuming it within the principles of interpretation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> Thus, the exclusion of pre-contractual negotiations remains as the unaccounted exception to the general application of the individualisation theory. However, given that courts are at least sceptical of its exclusion, there is a possibility that said exclusion may be removed (or at least revisited) in future cases.</p>

<h4 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h4>

<p>Individualisation has been shown to be able to explain the shift from textual to contextual; its further suitability can be seen as even a more nuanced analysis of contract interpretation fits within the theory. Tan argues that the reductionist perspective of distinguishing between textual and contextual should be abandoned for a more iterative  process of “contextual coherence” which can fully account for the “fault lines” which the above approaches are unable to adequately address<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> Yet even his suggested theory of interpretation seems to agree with individualisation, as the process does enhance both specific and collective individual freedoms through objective and rational selections of the most “coherent” text from multiple competing interpretations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a>) Consequently, individualisation does present itself as an attractive and, most importantly, reasonable principle behind the development of contract interpretation. The only problem faced by the theory is difficulties in proving its foundational aspect; all the evidence that has been presented merely demonstrates that the case law fits within the scope of the theory, thus fulfilling the conventionalist aspect. To confirm the deontological aspect of the theory will require an explicit mention by the judiciary that individualisation has been its guiding principle. Unfortunately, no amount of analysis will bring us to such an answer.</p>

	     <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p><em>Have you ever wondered how ‘West Side Story’ might have been resolved in the English courts? In such cases of gang violence, the area of complicity governs the typical situation where the accused (the ‘Accessory’) did not commit the crime but assisted or encouraged the principal offender to do so. This note analyses the impact of R v Jogee, arguably the most seminal case in this area of law,by tracing the legal and social aftermath of the decision. It begins by questioning how Jogee was initially lauded for its reversion back to principle, and the extent to which it truly righted a ‘wrong turn’ in the law by navigating the academic literature on the disputed issue of intention in the Jogee judgement. In discussing the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the current law on accomplice liability, this note ultimately still finds the law wanting of necessary clarifications. Moreover, a holistic approach to reform is required, including ensuring the integrity of prosecution charging decisions by removing the inaccurate racialised gang narrative permeating this area of law. This work was inspired by LSE’s Criminal Law syllabus on the topic of Complicity. I declare that it has not been submitted elsewhere.</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction <a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></h3>

<p>Pre-<em>Jogee</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> a defendant’s accessorial liability could be established via two avenues. First, under section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, where one could be charged with ‘ordinary’ accessorial liability by ‘aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring’ the principal’s offence. Second, via Parasitic Accessorial Liability (‘PAL’), an ‘extended’ form of joint enterprise liability (established in <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em>).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> If two parties undertook a joint enterprise to commit a crime whereby the principal committed a further offence, the secondary would be guilty as an accessory to that further crime (incurring liability ‘parasitic’ on the principal’s crime), if s/he foresaw that the principal would act as s/he did. <em>Jogee</em> purportedly abolished this second route, limiting the basis of criminalising secondary participation to basic accessorial liability.</p>

<p><em>Jogee</em> involved joint appeals for murder convictions where victims were killed by the principals’ use of a knife. However, the prosecution procured convictions by arguing that the defendants had engaged in a joint enterprise to commit the act which caused the victim’s death. In Mr Jogee’s case, he and Mr Hirsi became increasingly intoxicated whilst together. Later, they visited Mr Fyfe’s residence where they had heated exchanges with Mr Fyfe. Mr Fyfe was subsequently stabbed to death by Mr Hirsi. Mr Jogee had been outside striking a car with a bottle and shouting encouragement at Mr Hirsi to do something to Mr Fyfe. Both men ran off after the stabbing.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Mr Jogee was convicted on the basis that he <strong>foresaw</strong> the principal might intentionally cause grievous bodily harm or murder if the circumstances arose. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction and effected a change to the mens rea requirement, requiring him to have <strong>known or intended</strong> that Mr Hirsi would have intentionally caused grievous harm if the circumstances arose.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>Thus, <em>Jogee’s</em> abolition of the PAL doctrine reflects a swing of the judicial pendulum from a crime-control model based on public policy reasons, back to a due-process model grounded on principled reasons (pre-existing <em>Powell</em>).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> For our purposes, the most salient traits of the due-process model embody the ‘minimal assumption’ that the defendant is innocent until an impartial adversarial trial process. The crime-control model prioritises repression of any criminal conduct and regards preliminary screening by the police and prosecution as ‘adequate guarantees of reliable factfinding’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>In theory, while <em>Jogee</em> limits the scope of joint enterprise and brings the jurisprudence of joint enterprise back to principled grounds, it does not necessarily eradicate the operation of PAL. In practice, the highly restrictive judicial approach to appeals that has developed since <em>Jogee</em>, and discriminatory prosecutorial framework based upon a racialised gang narrative present additional challenges to the ‘ground-breaking’ status <em>Jogee</em> was lauded for when it was decided five years ago. It is worth mentioning from the outset that joint enterprise is a heavily politicised doctrine, which provided prosecutors with a brutal but effective mode of crackdown on homicide cases. Hence, clarity is needed to prevent undue side effects of the judgement from materialising, and a wider approach to reform is also required to adequately deal with the doctrine’s social impact.</p>

<h3 id="theoretical-analysis">Theoretical Analysis</h3>

<p><em>Jogee</em> abolished the doctrine of PAL, with the central aspect of change involving the fault element required in PAL. It raised the mens rea threshold for the secondary party from foreseeing (established in <em>Chan Wing Siu</em>) to intending to assist or encourage the principal’s actus reus and mens rea in committing the crime (per <em>Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1975)</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<h4 id="past-policy-significance-of-pal"><em>Past policy significance of PAL</em></h4>

<p>Simester’s moral forfeiture theory of liability provides a justification in principle for joint enterprise,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> whereby a group constituted by joint enterprise has set itself against the law and society at large. However, given the doctrine’s expansiveness, it is realistically more likely motivated bypolicy concerns of exercising deterrence and public protection. As Lord Steyn in <em>Powell</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> points out, the accessory principle is ‘needed and cannot be abolished or relaxed’ because of the ‘social problem’ that ‘criminal enterprises’ often ‘escalate into the commission of greater offences’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> This understanding aligns with the psychological ‘risky shift phenomenon’, whereby an individual’s estimation of risk is skewed when acting as part of a group and may act in a more extreme manner.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> The House of Lords in <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> seemed to conceive PAL as essential to prevent an accomplice from evading the consequences of a criminal enterprise, seemingly taking any occasional injustices in its stride as ‘necessary evil’. The stakes are high given that in England and Wales, the accomplice is punished for the same offence as the principal. In effect, it was possible to sentence the accomplice to life imprisonment as long as s/he was <strong>reckless</strong> to the commission of murder, despite not having intended murder to be committed. The disparity of treatment between the principal and accomplice was particularly problematic for homicide, which has a mandatory life imprisonment sentence. This created a legal limbo between convicting the accomplice for the full offence of murder or letting them go scot free although they may not have been fully innocent. Neither options in this binary system proportionately label the accessory’s liability nor provide the flexibility to charge them according to their degree of involvement.</p>

<p>The developing backdrop of policy reasons has not only caused PAL to incriminate disproportionately but also caused confusion for accessory liability generally. <em>Gnango</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> has exemplified the confusion over joint enterprise, where the victim was caught in crossfire between two gunmen on the way home. Finding that two characters with diametrically opposed intents were engaged in a joint enterprise undermined the assumption that parties in a joint enterprise would be acting in concert. This legal fiction imputed foresight where it was non-existent, equating it to intention, thus revealing a blatant policy-driven approach where joint enterprise principles have been twisted and stretched to establish full liability for murder. As Virgo argues, the judgements of Lords Clarke, Brown and Dyson allowed the significance of the relevance of a joint enterprise to overwhelm the need to prove actus reus and mens rea by ‘completely ignoring’ the two fundamental principles.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>This evinces the degree of prevalent confusion that is the ‘characteristic weaknesses’ of a doctrine that was allowed to develop in a ‘pragmatic and unprincipled’ manner.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a></p>

<h4 id="restoration-of-principle"><em>Restoration of Principle</em></h4>

<p>Thus, <em>Jogee</em> arguably brings accessorial liability back to principled grounds, righting a ‘wrong turn’ of ‘questionable policy arguments’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> The PAL doctrine in <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> had shifted the focus of the mens rea requirement onto the accessory’s foresight on what the principal might do, rather than on his intention of how the principal should act, drastically lowering the threshold for convicting defendants involved in a joint criminal venture. The bar is further lowered in cases where it is unclear whether the defendant is the principal or the accessory; as <em>Gianetto</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> shows, the prosecution need only prove that the defendant possessed the requisite mens rea and contributed to the end result to be held fully responsible for the crime.</p>

<p>In <em>Jogee,</em> the Supreme Court clarified that foresight is no more than ‘evidence’ for the requisite intention; while intention may be ‘conditional’, the jury must be sure that a defendant on trial as a secondary had intended the criminal outcome. This upholds several cardinal principles within the criminal law, including the principles of responsibility <a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> that one should only be held responsible for his intended acts, as well as proportionality and fair labelling in sentencing. Pre-<em>Jogee,</em> the judge was obliged to sentence convicted secondary participants to mandatory life imprisonment, although they might have been convicted on mere foresight.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> The situation reeks of injustice with the blatant lack of discretion to mitigate the sentence according to the defendant’s level of involvement. As Wilson and Ormerod argue, if the law wishes to hold a defendant liable for reckless foresight and the ‘danger his own acts excite’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> the appropriate charge is one of manslaughter (the substituted crime Jogee was sentenced for), but not murder. This has been explicitly confirmed in paragraph 96 of <em>Jogee</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> Now, the possibility of a substitute manslaughter conviction allows for the judge to vary the sentence proportionate to individual culpability.</p>

<p>However, the assertion that complicity has been restricted through the elimination of PAL may not be entirely valid given the blurry intention/foresight distinction and the shifted focus on to conditional intent in <em>Jogee</em>.</p>

<h4 id="residual-unclarity--backdoor-for-pal"><em>Residual Unclarity = Backdoor for PAL?</em></h4>

<p>Although the court recognised that foresight was ‘good evidence’ of intention and that the two were ‘not synonymous’, <em>Jogee</em> is crucially silent on what threshold of foresight from the defendant might enable a jury to infer requisite intent. This could lead to juries readily inferring intent from some ‘middling’ degree of foresight,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> effectively neutralising <em>Jogee</em>’s effect on complicity.</p>

<p>Moreover, the courts left open the question as to whether oblique intention in secondary liability was to be treated similarly as in the law of murder, notably without addressing <em>Woollin</em> where a high threshold of foresight (‘virtual certainty’) is considered sufficient intention. <em>Jogee</em>’s ambivalence may allow the jury to infer an accessory’s intent to murder based on foresight alone, including a lower level than virtual certainty. Krebs highlights that ‘as long as <em>Woollin</em> remains good law’, <em>Jogee</em> cannot achieve its aim of restoring parity of culpability between the principal and accessory.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> However ‘virtually certain’ an accessory may be of a principal’s plans, this remains ‘a far cry from the certainty of future <em>causal</em> developments described in <em>Woollin</em>‘<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a>: This presumed application of <em>Woollin</em> in accessorial liability cases is also problematic in <strong>two</strong> senses: First, <em>Woollin</em> is epistemically problematic in the joint enterprise situation where multiple actors are involved. Liability is essentially determined on another free human being acting conditionally. Secondly, even where the accessory has the requisite conditional intent, ‘any number of things might transpire to deter’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> the principal from killing. Given the accessory has no bearing on both of these issues, this reinforces how the accessory’s agency over culpability for their own actions remains lacking due to unclarity as to how other doctrines might apply.</p>

<p><em>Jogee</em> also recognises that the accessory’s conditional intent will be sufficient mens rea. The enlargement of the role of conditional intent may be restrictive for collateral which is less likely to be attributable to complicity parties due to an evidential lack of prior planning. However, Ashworth highlights how the retention of conditional intent allows the jury to infer intention and ‘tacit agreement’ through foresight in effect, if s/he foresaw that the principal might decide to intentionally inflict that level of harm.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> This bears ‘striking resemblance’ to parasitic accessorial liability as Smith has noted.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Perhaps, this gives credence to Stark’s observation that <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> was not a wrong turning of the law as <em>Jogee</em> portrayed, but an honest recognition of what the law is, citing a ‘wider principle’ beyond the standard assisting and encouraging whereby the accessory is criminally liable for the principal’s acts ‘of a type which [s/he] foresees but does not necessarily intend’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> Hence it seems that PAL has not been abolished but rather ‘tamed’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> perhaps operating more covertly as recognised by the Hong Kong case <em>Chan Kam-Shing</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> where the formulation of conditional intent in <em>Anwar</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> (‘if the circumstances arise’) was taken to be suggestive that English law was drifting back to joint criminal enterprise. On this basis, <em>Jogee</em>’s restriction of the complicity’s scope seems ‘less than might have been appreciated’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> as it is formal rather than substantive.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a></p>

<h4 id="is-residual-unclarity-entirely-undesirable"><em>Is Residual Unclarity Entirely Undesirable?</em></h4>

<p>While <em>Jogee</em> signals an intention to return to more principled grounds, more clarity on the requisite threshold of foresight is necessary to ensure legal consistency and certainty, all the more imperative given the heavy charges and high stakes involved. Ashworth has argued against any leeway on the requisite degree of foresight to infer intention, contending that the courts should aim to introduce a tighter definition of intention for such a serious offence and deal with more complicated cases using defences or partial defences.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> However, this argument assumes that <em>Jogee</em> was trying to substantively define intention in the first place. One might question if it is even possible for the Supreme Court to provide a threshold that would provide clear guidance in the multiplicity of joint enterprise cases, without being a mere empty label. It is easier to make a negative statement that foresight was not intention, but harder to provide positive guidance for the threshold of foresight that would amount to intention. Moreover, it is notable that the concept of foresight being taken as evidence for intention was not birthed from <em>Jogee</em>, but appears in virtually every single case. When framing charges, the prosecution works to convince the jury to draw the necessary inference of intention from foresight. As expressed by Lord Bridge in <em>Moloney</em>, ‘[foreseeability] belongs, not to the substantive law, but to the law of evidence’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a></p>

<p>While Ormerod and Laird have rightly criticised the ambiguity of the new mens rea requirement,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> it might be argued ambiguity is not necessarily wholly undesirable. Rather, it may mean flexibility allowing for the law to cater to a range of defendant profiles. Instead of providing a backdoor for the old law to creep in, it might be perceived as a tool allowing the jury to convict where the defendant is highly culpable, similar to the retention of jury ‘moral elbow room’ as in <em>Woollin</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> a term coined by Horder referring to the jury’s discretion on whether the crime fits the defendant’s conduct.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> One’s view of the legal inbuilt flexibility left in <em>Jogee</em>’s wake may to a certain extent turn on one’s trust in the exercise of discretion by the judge and jury. It also allows the accessory a chance to argue that while s/he might have had some level of foresight, it did not amount to intention. Comparatively, the previous approach meant that any foresight made a conviction virtually certain.</p>

<p>Overall, the extent to which complicity has been restricted in practice is questionable. Given the Supreme Court’s vague treatment of the actus reus requirement of joint enterprise as a ‘common unlawful purpose’, the fundamental effectiveness of <em>Jogee</em>’s purported abolition of PAL is debatable. Hence, Virgo’s perspective of the implicit existence of PAL as a ‘backdoor’ is arguably more convincing than Simester’s view that PAL has been successfully abolished by <em>Jogee</em>’s return to principle.</p>

<h3 id="observations-in-practice">Observations in Practice</h3>

<p>Moreover, the theoretical potential for PAL to creep back into the law is an even more realistic practical concern when contextualised in the reality of discriminatory prosecutorial practices, coupled with low prospect of successful appeals.</p>

<h4 id="high-threshold-for-appeals"><em>High threshold for appeals</em></h4>

<p>Ormerod and Laird have postulated that the Supreme Court may have intended for conditional intent to apply only in limited circumstances.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> However, Dyson points out that in practice, a defendant convicted under PAL may still be liable through having conditional intent that the principal will commit the crime.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> This was starkly demonstrated in <em>R v Johnson and Others,</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a>where the Court of Appeal faced a range of appeals contending wrongful convictions under the old law.Yet, it appeared surprisingly easy to establish that accomplices liable for PAL would now be convicted of murder based on conditional intent.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> The court appeared confident that in all cases, the appellants had the ‘necessary conditional intent’ that the weapon be used with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<p>To bring an appeal against a conviction ‘out of time’ (lodged over 28 days post-conviction), an applicant needs ‘exceptional leave’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> and this will only be granted if the applicant can demonstrate having suffered ‘a substantial injustice’ due to the change in the law. The Court of Appeal made clear that they were not interested in investigating whether the change <em>might</em> have made a difference to the verdict, or whether the applicant suffered adverse consequences from conviction, such as stigmatisation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> The court admitted this was ‘a high threshold’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> but it has proven relatively insurmountable. To date, only one case (<em>R v Crilly</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a>) has successfully appealed under <em>Jogee</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> and the Court of Appeal was clear to present a ‘faithful’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> adherence to the restrictive approach in <em>Johnson</em>. The focus is not on jury misdirection but the basis of prosecution itself - in <em>Crilly,</em> the prosecution’s case was evidently ‘to all intents and purposes a case about his foresight’,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> as opposed to intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<h4 id="unchanged-framework-of-discriminatory-prosecutorial-practices-and-institutionalised-racism"><em>Unchanged framework of discriminatory prosecutorial practices and institutionalised racism</em></h4>

<p>Yet, even for the rare successful appeal applicants and defendants post-<em>Jogee</em>, there is little relief in practice. Consideration of the law post-<em>Jogee</em> has shown disappointing realisation of the regressive potential of <em>Jogee</em>’s uncertainties.</p>

<p>Socially, PAL critics were less preoccupied with the unprincipled elision of mens rea levels but more concerned with the extensive, disproportionate and discriminatory incrimination. The Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge found that joint enterprise convictions lead to three times as many black men serving life sentences than those in the general prison population.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> Birkbeck’s Prison Reform Trust study found that two-thirds of their sample belonged to a minority ethnic group, and over 40% were black.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> Similar trends can be found in the age of joint enterprise convicts, slanting heavily toward 18-24 year olds with a surprising number of under-18 convictions as well.</p>

<p>Underlying PAL’s propensity for the conviction of young minorities is a narrative rooted in the justification for joint enterprise itself.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> The oft-peddled explanation for the need of such an expansive tool of incrimination is the difficulty of prosecuting gang crimes - the confusion of who did what and who said what creates intensive prosecutorial difficulties to illustrate to the jury the role each defendant played in the overall crime. During the rampant public disorders of the 1980s, the police were given enhanced stop and search powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 (also the year <em>Chan Wing-Siu</em> was decided). The reputational expansiveness of joint criminal enterprise led its acronym ‘JCE’ to be referred to as ‘Just Convict Everyone’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Furthermore, ‘suspect populations’ were identified to have greater propensity to engage in organised crime, discriminatorily targeting ethnic minority communities and controversially conflating the ‘criminal gang’ with ‘Black youths’ in media and political discourse.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a></p>

<p>Joint Enterprise is therefore a political tool for simplification of both the prosecution and jury’s task. The Crown Prosecution Service’s own direction on the relevance of ‘gang’ references explains its utility as an evidentiary basis for a chain of inferences.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> Association with a gang can lead to an inference of knowledge of the gang’s predisposition for violence, which can lead to an inference of the requisite mens rea.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> <em>Jogee</em> does not change all this. Although the requisite mens rea is changed from foresight to intention, the jury is free to infer intention from foresight. <em>Jogee</em> merely adds another link in the chain of inference starting from gang association to conviction. It would be ‘misguided’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> to assume that the prosecuting parties would not continue making the same extended inferences from gang associations. With the pressing doctrinal questions that <em>Jogee</em> leaves unresolved, the same issues with joint enterprise may well continue to be systemically perpetuated. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has adduced evidence demonstrating that convictions are being secured in our courts without sufficient evidence to convict, especially in cases where there are <strong>more</strong> defendants when the CPS is ‘more likely to offer no evidence’ for at least some defendants.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> <em>Jogee</em>’s framework does not prohibit this. This is particularly problematic in light of the questionable relationship between joint enterprise and the racialised gang narrative.</p>

<p>The problem is that ‘gang’ narratives seem to be part and parcel of some joint enterprise prosecutions regardless of whether the label fits. The CPS is adamant that ‘gang’ references must be ‘cautious[ly]’ made and only invoked with a proper ‘evidential basis’, but it seems like the bar for what counts as ‘evidence’ can be grossly low.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> The widely reported ‘Moss Side’ murder case provides a clear demonstration of <em>Jogee</em>’s equivocal aspects. Eleven defendants aged 14-20, all ethnic minorities, were convicted on the basis of joint enterprise liability in <em>R v Goodall</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> During the trial, the prosecution explained that when the defendants chased and beat the victim, culminating in one of the defendants delivering a fatal stab, it was a co-ordinated gang attack on a member of a rival gang.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a> In terms of evidence, the Crown claimed the defendants had ‘self-admissions’ of gang memberships.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline62" href="#62">62</a> Yet, the calibre of evidence presented to evince gang affiliations was apparently the fact that some of the defendants did hand signs in their Instagram pictures, which the prosecution argued amounted to admission of gang affiliations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline63" href="#63">63</a> Those for whom such condemnatory evidence was not found, had their association proven on the basis of their friendships with those who had.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline64" href="#64">64</a> The presence of a ‘gang’ provided a prosecutorial framework to construct a hindsight narrative of the facts, presenting a situation that reportedly sporadically developed as organised crime.</p>

<p>The empirical evidence for this is faltering. Hallsworth’s behavioural research shows that on the streets, gang structures are ‘radically informal and non-hierarchical’ and organisational plans are ‘situationally determined and driven’ rather than premeditated.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline65" href="#65">65</a> The ‘gang’ discourse therefore problematically permeates prosecutorial tendencies, since the evidence does not meet Feinberg’s threshold of ‘a very high degree of antecedent group solidarity’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline66" href="#66">66</a> to render this framework morally acceptable. Moreover, the inbuilt biases of the racialised gang narrative further compromise on the integrity of the policing process. Amnesty International’s recent report has highlighted the Gangs Matrix database used by the Metropolitan Police as racially stigmatising and the ‘wrong tool for the wrong problem’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline67" href="#67">67</a></p>

<p>Recognising that gang associations are based on dubious evidential grounds, the statistic that almost 80% of ethnic-minority joint enterprise prisoners were labelled gang members compared to 38.5% of white prisoners is condemnatory and discriminatory.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline68" href="#68">68</a> When the basis of a defendant’s gang association is suspect, it is difficult not to be critical of the fact that joint enterprise post-<em>Jogee</em> still allows the prosecution to draw and the jury to follow a chain of inferences that leads rather conveniently down a slippery slope from ‘possible gang member’ to ‘guilty’. In this respect, the jury’s discretion left in <em>Jogee</em> compounded by prosecutorial discretion in the law enforcement system may not have addressed a problematic status quo of institutional racism at all but perpetuated it.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Theoretically, <em>Jogee</em> on paper is a much-needed reversion back to principle, allowing for fair labelling of criminals by raising the mens rea requirement to reflect their culpability more accurately. However, many potential issues remain unclarified, notably whether it truly does change the law or simply allow the old law to operate beneath indeterminate wording. Coupled with the practical context that access to appeals is heavily restricted and the inbuilt biases in the prosecution procedures, it is submitted that until these elements are rectified, we remain yoked to the underlying vestiges of the crime-control model. The Supreme Court may have held that PAL was a ‘wrong turn’ in the law, yet a real reversion to a due-process model to achieve truly criminally just outcomes in the law of Joint Enterprise would require holistic reform: to internally develop and clarify the substantive law, and externally regulate and eliminate biases from the prosecutorial framework.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>In <em>Elgizouli v Secretary of State for the Home Department</em>, the Supreme Court considered whether it was unlawful for the Secretary of State to authorise mutual legal assistance (“MLA”) to the United States in order to assist a criminal investigation which could lead to the imposition of the death penalty on a suspected British terrorist.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> This article first sets out the factual background and context of this case. It will then go on to examine the Court’s reasoning, particularly on the legality of the Secretary of State’s actions on the basis of common law principles.</p>

<p>The article will situate <em>Elgizouli</em> within existing jurisprudence on common law constitutional rights. In doing so, it will argue that the Court has revealed a more restrictive approach to such rights. Finally, this article will discuss how <em>Elgizouli</em> demonstrates that the scope of common law constitutional rights seems to be limited to procedural rights (as opposed to substantive rights).</p>

<h4 id="background-of-elgizouli">Background of <em>Elgizouli</em></h4>

<p>In <em>Elgizouli</em>, the applicant’s son was suspected of involvement in a terrorist group which committed serious crimes, including the beheading of 27 men in Syria.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> In 2015, the US requested MLA – which enables the US and UK governments to share information for the purposes of criminal proceedings – with respect to an investigation into that terrorist group.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> While the Home Secretary requested the US guarantee that information provided would not be used in a prosecution that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty, the US did not provide such an assurance. Despite the lack of this assurance from the US, the Home Secretary agreed to the MLA request and supplied relevant information to US authorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> While witness statements had already been transferred to US authorities before the case was brought to the courts, the Supreme Court nonetheless emphasised the importance of determining the legality of the Home Secretary’s actions as “[f]urther material may be sought” <a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> by US authorities.</p>

<p>At first instance, it was held in the Divisional Court that the Home Secretary’s actions were neither unlawful under the common law nor the provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> However, the Divisional Court certified two questions of law of public importance: (i) whether the Home Secretary’s exercise of power to provide MLA which will facilitate the imposition of the death penalty was unlawful under the common law; and (ii) whether the Home Secretary’s exercise of power was unlawful under the provisions of the DPA 2018.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> This article will focus on the Supreme Court’s reasoning as to whether the Secretary of State’s actions were unlawful under the common law.</p>

<h5 id="the-supreme-courts-reasoning">The Supreme Court’s reasoning</h5>

<p>The majority held that there was no common law principle which prevented the sharing of information in an MLA request which might lead to the imposition of the death penalty. Lord Kerr was the sole dissenter on this issue and held that the common law ought to recognise that it should be unlawful to facilitate investigations by providing material which might lead to the imposition of the death penalty in a foreign country.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> Of importance is the Justices’ reasoning on the scope of common law constitutional rights and how the common law should (or should not) develop to accommodate new rights.</p>

<p>Giving one of the two substantive judgments of the majority, Lord Carnwath pointed out that “the death penalty […] has never attracted the attention of the common law” with recent developments coming from Parliament or the European Court of Human Rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Consequently, the common law must develop “in line with the European Convention, but not beyond”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> More crucially, as this was a case involving the facilitation of the death penalty by the transfer of information, “the development of a common law rule would have to take account of the fact that […] Parliament has recently legislated in this field, in the 2018 Act”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Given the highly detailed nature of data transfer rules under the DPA 2018, a common law prohibition of transfer of information in certain circumstances could not be reconciled with the statutory data protection regime.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Lord Carnwath thus evinced a limited scope for the development of common law constitutional rights, with such rights inextricably bound up with pre-existing Convention rights and legislative frameworks.</p>

<p>Beyond affirming Lord Carnwath’s reasons, Lord Reed (with whom Lady Black and Lord Llyod-Jones agreed) further argued that the development of the common law must build “incrementally on existing principles”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> In the first place, incremental development preserves “legal certainty” by ensuring that any changes to the common law are undertaken based on “established principles”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Furthermore, parliamentary sovereignty means that the courts should be cautious when developing the common law especially with the “procedural and institutional limitations which restrict the ability of litigation before the courts to act as an engine of law reform”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Against this broader principle, Lord Reed was of the opinion that the common law was not capable of supplying a right prohibiting MLA which could potentially lead to the death penalty because such a right would not be “an incremental step”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Drawing on constitutional and legal policy justifications, Lord Reed similarly envisioned a more restrictive role for the courts in the development of new rights under the common law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Lord Kerr adopted a different approach to common law constitutional rights. Upon examining different sources of constitutional rights, Lord Kerr argued that recognising a right against the provision of information in an MLA request that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty was a “natural and inevitable extension” of the current prohibition of extradition without death penalty assurances.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> In particular, Lord Kerr emphasised that the common law should adapt to afford human rights protection in novel cases; Convention rights merely “represent a threshold protection” and cannot act as “an inhibitor to the development of the common law” in human rights jurisprudence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Lord Kerr thus took a more liberal approach to common law constitutional rights, with the common law being capable of independently evolving to supply human rights protection.</p>

<p>As Fairclough notes, <em>Elgizouli</em> is significant because it lays out key areas of dispute in common law constitutional rights – both relating to “the relationship between the common law and the HRA” as well as “the extent to which common-law rights can develop”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> While Lords Carnwath and Reed arguably conceptualised a more deferential role for common law constitutional rights (both in its relationship to the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”) and the development of new principles), Lord Kerr posited that the common law could dynamically develop outside the boundaries of Convention rights.</p>

<h4 id="analysis">Analysis</h4>

<p>To contextualise the significance of <em>Elgizouli</em>, it is important to understand the developing jurisprudence on common law constitutional rights. In recent years, the courts have seemingly engendered a new approach to common law constitutional rights. In particular, the judges have stressed the vigour of the common law in supplying human rights protection. Such an approach was particularly evident in <em>Osborn v Parole Board</em>, where the Supreme Court stated that the HRA “does not supersede the protection of human rights under the common law or statute, or create a discrete body of law based upon the judgements of the European court”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> Instead, the courts should develop constitutional rights in parallel to the HRA. As Elliott notes, <em>Osborn</em> was remarkable in that it “places common-law rights centre-stage, [with] consideration of the ECHR being treated as a secondary matter”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> The possibility for common law constitutional rights to take precedence over and even supply stronger protection than the HRA was demonstrated in two subsequent cases. In <em>Kennedy v The Charity Commission</em>, the claimant argued that Article 10 of the Convention included a right to receive information from public authorities. Rejecting this argument, the Court went on to hold that there was a “common law presumption in favour of openness”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> and that a right to receive information from public authorities could possibly be supplied by the common law. Subsequently, in <em>A v BBC</em>, the Court emphasised that the “common law principle of open justice remains in vigour, even when Convention rights are also applicable”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> As such, this trilogy of cases suggests that the courts have been willing to develop a richer catalogue of common law constitutional rights and that the common law could itself act as a robust defender of human rights.</p>

<p>At first blush, the majority’s reasoning in <em>Elgizouli</em> evinces a much stricter approach to common law constitutional rights and seems to contradict the Court’s liberal approach in the trilogy of cases just discussed. In <em>Osborn</em>, <em>Kennedy</em> and <em>BBC</em>, common law constitutional rights occupied a central position and could even take precedence over the HRA. Yet, common law constitutional rights took a backseat in <em>Elgizouli</em>. In <em>Elgizouli</em>, Lords Reed and Carnwath stated that common law constitutional rights must cautiously and incrementally develop, curtailing the capacity of the common law to evolve and provide stronger human rights protection. The question, then, is whether these positions can be reconciled; or if they cannot, perhaps it might be said that <em>Elgizouli</em> represents the advent of a stricter approach to common law constitutional rights.</p>

<p>On closer analysis, what <em>Elgizouli</em> reveals is that the ambit of common law rights protection has always been relatively limited in scope. In <em>Kennedy</em> and <em>BBC</em>, the right in question was a right to open justice. As Elliott argues, the Court may be particularly willing to enforce certain rights where they are “a reflection of a constitutional principle to which especial curial weight is attached”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> This could explain why a right to open justice was particularly prized by the Court in <em>Kennedy</em> and <em>BBC</em>, as the notion of open justice is tied to rule of law considerations such as transparency and accountability.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> As such, while the common law might be generous with applying certain kinds of rights which are firmly grounded in well-established constitutional principles (such as a right to open justice), they are more reticent when it comes to recognising new types of rights (such as a right against non-facilitation of the death penalty). On this reasoning, <em>Elgizouli</em> sheds light on the limited normative reach of common law constitutional rights as well as the common law’s selectivity in its protection of human rights. While it might be too early to draw a conclusion on the precise scope of common law constitutional rights, it could be argued that the common law is more willing to enforce procedural rights as opposed to substantive rights, especially when those rights are linked to fundamental constitutional principles such as the rule of law.</p>

<p>This reading of <em>Elgizouli</em> might be supported by the judgement of the Supreme Court in <em>Moohan v Lord Advocate</em>. In <em>Moohan</em>, the Court considered the legality of the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 which banned prisoners from voting in the referendum.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Of note is the Court’s discussion of the common law position on the right to vote, which is a substantive rather than procedural right. Lord Hodge stated that the common law has not developed to “recognise a right of universal and equal suffrage from which any derogation must be provided for by law and must be proportionate”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> In so holding, Lord Hodge observed that the right to vote has always been a statutory creation and that it would thus be constitutionally inappropriate for the common law to “override the statutory rules which determine our democratic franchise”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> The Court’s reticence to recognise a right to vote at common law in <em>Moohan</em> aligns with the Court’s reluctance to extend the protection of the common law to the prohibition of supplying information in an MLA which might lead to the death penalty in <em>Elgizouli</em>. Ultimately, as Elliot argues, it seems that “only a subset of common law rights […] form an irreducible nucleus that may be resistant in the face of implacably incompatible primary legislation”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a></p>

<p>Where does this leave us? While <em>Elgizouli</em> does not bring us closer to drawing up a specific catalogue of rights which exist at the common law, it reminds us that common law constitutional rights are ultimately limited in breadth. While the common law might be a rigorous form of human rights protection when it comes to certain types of rights, other forms of rights are delimited from its scope. In particular, the majority in <em>Elgizouli</em> seems to have adopted an especially narrow conception of common law rights, with the development of such rights being constrained by statutory law and pre-existing rights enshrined in the common law. In this regard, there is a strong argument in favour of Lord Kerr’s approach, as he posits that the courts should extend common law principles to supply human rights protection in novel cases. This ties in with Fairclough’s argument that the common law should move towards a more principled approach to the identification of common law constitutional rights – by recognising that common law constitutional rights are normatively underpinned by the rule of law, this opens up the space for more rights to be protected by the common law insofar as they are underpinned by rule of law considerations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Ultimately, while the current scope of common law constitutional rights appears limited, we may not need to be overly concerned as things currently stand. This is because the HRA can be seen as a sufficiently rigorous way of ensuring that human rights are protected in the UK. This is especially so considering that the courts have a far-reaching interpretative duty under Section 3(1) of the HRA to give effect to Convention rights. In particular, the courts have been willing to “depart from the unambiguous meaning of the legislation” to achieve an interpretation that is consistent with the protection of human rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> As such, it could be argued that, where the common law is currently lacking, the HRA fills the lacuna.</p>

<p><em>Elgizouli</em> confirms that the courts are selective when it comes to the breadth of common law constitutional rights. While the picture of human rights protection is not necessarily bleak due to the HRA, we might be more concerned if the HRA faces repeal in the future. It should be noted that the government launched an independent review of the HRA (led by Sir Peter Gross) in December 2020, focusing on the “structural framework” of the HRA instead of the substantive rights encapsulated in the HRA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> While it seems unlikely that the HRA will be repealed in the near future, it remains to be seen how the outcome of the independent review might alter the current working of the HRA. In this sense, <em>Elgizouli</em> serves as a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring that the HRA has the capacity to effectively protect human rights, as common law constitutional rights are unable to offer the same rigour of protection as the HRA.</p>

	     <h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>Western countries take pride in their orderly constitutional systems which reflect their aspirations to respect human rights and the rule of law (“RoL”). However, when considering the actual meaning and intended genuine effect of the RoL, the concept actually generates more confusion than its inconclusive terminology suggests.</p>

<p>Situating the concept of the RoL in the British constitutional system and identifying its role in the exercise of law-making reveals unexpected complications. Recent events, such as Brexit negotiations and the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for the exploration of the true meaning of the RoL in modern Britain and evaluating its role in the British constitution.</p>

<p>Last year, Parliament enacted the Coronavirus Act 2020, in which it granted the Government extensive discretionary powers through delegated legislation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> Later in the year, the Government proposed clauses in the Internal Market Bill that would directly breach international law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> Even though the events clearly had major implications for the RoL, the Government and Parliament were still allowed to proceed with their agenda. The events demonstrate the elusiveness of the RoL and how easily the concept is disregarded. But why has the constitutional order, purportedly based on the RoL, not disintegrated and collapsed? The answer to this question might lie in the fact that the RoL does not hold any tangible value because of its conceptual uncertainty. The concept is correctly encapsulated by Tamanaha, who noted that “everyone is for [the RoL], but have contrasting convictions about what it is”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></p>

<p>This article will argue that the RoL exists only as a descriptive concept of the modern constitution, without a clear definition in both procedural accounts (arguing that the RoL covers only the form of law and its procedures) and substantive accounts (arguing that in addition to its procedural component, the RoL should also require compliance with the substance of the law and human rights). This makes it open to attacks and incapable of being justified by strong argumentation in the legal context. The article will proceed with discussing the incompatibility of a prescriptive RoL with the British constitutional system, particularly with the central principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Moreover, it will explore the role of the RoL in Britain’s political structure and raise concerns about the potential for abuse in this context. The article will conclude with proposals about the future of the RoL.</p>

<h3 id="the-rule-of-law-reassessed">THE RULE OF LAW REASSESSED</h3>

<h4 id="-the-predicament-of-defining-the-rule-of-law-"><u> The predicament of defining the rule of law </u></h4>

<p>British jurists have attempted to define the RoL for more than a century. The most comprehensive explanation of the RoL was provided by Lord Bingham, who listed both procedural and substantive ˝sub-rules˝ that constituted the RoL.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> However, Lord Bingham himself recognised that statutory law does not define the RoL – with the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 being the only statute that mentions the RoL. The Act’s Section 1(a) states: “The Act does not adversely affect the existing constitutional principle of the rule of law”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> According to Bingham, the authors of the 2005 Act found the task of defining the RoL too complex and therefore left it to the judiciary.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> Therefore, the principle is referred to in an Act of Parliament without any comprehensive definition. Arguing before the court that this constitutional principle has been infringed would be extremely onerous. In any event, it goes against the principle of legal certainty.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Even though it remains a legal principle, paradoxically, it also goes against Bingham’s own elaboration on the RoL, presenting the requirement of laws being clear, predictable and questions of legal rights being resolved by application of law and not the exercise of discretion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The principle’s presence in an Act of Parliament would undoubtedly require more certainty as to its meaning than other non-codified principles.</p>

<p>Dicey’s <em>Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution</em> also shed light on the issues of defining the RoL by drawing both from procedural and substantive accounts. Dicey emphasised that the RoL is an inherent feature of English institutions, as opposed to other European countries, e.g., France.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> He stressed three elements that make the English legal system the perfect manifestation of the RoL. Firstly, he claimed that no citizen will be punished except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before ordinary Courts of the land.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Secondly, Dicey reiterated the value of equality under the common law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Thirdly, he stressed that the English constitution’s protection of personal liberties is a result of “judicial decisions on rights of private persons” and not a result of some general principles in foreign constitutions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> There are two aspects of this interpretation worth mentioning: firstly, using judicial decisions and common law as primary proof for the RoL is perhaps not the most convincing argument. It is difficult to establish that judges were guided by the RoL in decision-making while authors of other constitutions were not. Even though judges decide cases in line with procedural requirements, it is still their interpretation of fact and law. Their decisions in many cases, with the lack of common law and statutory basis, tend to be discretionary. Moreover, Supreme Court Justices, despite being bound by the <em>stare decisis</em> doctrine, can evidently still change previously decided law if there are strong grounds for that decision.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a></p>

<p>Secondly, Dicey’s account clearly demonstrates that the RoL is a descriptive rather than prescriptive concept. The constitutional system contains certain elements that, when analysed jointly, encapsulate the RoL – however, rather than the concept acting as a norm or rule that the state ought to comply with, the rule of law instead describes law-making in Britain. While Dicey showed that the RoL was present in the British constitution, Britain itself did not aspire to achieve this ideal, but rather created the system and institutions which turned out to contain characteristics and an inherent value of what Dicey saw as the RoL. In the words of Finnis, Dicey’s RoL is merely “the name commonly given to the state of affairs in which a legal system is legally in good shape”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> That is why it would be hard to say that the RoL is a British achievement as it would be impossible to prove that the concept was the absolute objective of British judges as proposed by Dicey. It is what simultaneously arose with the creation of the British legal system and did not precede its creation.</p>

<p>The descriptive nature of the RoL can also be traced in the procedural account of another legal philosopher, Joseph Raz, who recognised conformity to the RoL as an inherent (but non-prescriptive) value in law-making and a result of an instrumental conception of law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> Raz created his own list of principles best explaining the RoL, and particularly emphasised the notions of certainty and prospectivity of laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Evincing a procedural account, Raz associated the RoL with the protection of individuals’ freedom to plan their lives, in the spirit of Hayekian philosophy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> Raz suggested that the RoL minimises (or attempts to minimise) the danger of infringing people’s freedom by requiring clear and prospective laws which prevents the danger of ruling by arbitrary power.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a></p>

<p>However, we should question whether the RoL as such (representing legal certainty, predictability and accessibility as proposed by Bingham) is necessary, as its component principles already exist in the British constitution. As Raz himself noted, the RoL is only one of the virtues of today’s laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Indeed, we can find traces of the RoL, in terms of certainty and predictability, in laws. But it is highly questionable whether the constitutional system really requires the umbrella term of the RoL when other, clearer and better established (or at least established to the degree valuable for them to be) legal principles serve a similar purpose. Looking at the RoL as one of law’s inherent virtues, as presented by Raz, the descriptiveness of the concept is additionally reaffirmed by some substantive accounts, like Dworkin’s. His position that the RoL does not stipulate only the narrow ‘rule-book conception’, but that the concept encapsulates people’s moral and political rights,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> calls for rebuttal. With strong emphasis on substantive justice, rights, and even morality, the rights conception cannot introduce a universal RoL concept, and can only describe the understanding of these elements in a specific jurisdiction. After all, even the judge Hercules must rely on the “convictions of his nation’s character”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>Since, as argued by this article, the RoL is not a prescriptive concept, conformity is not required. Despite Raz’s, Bingham’s and others’ explanations, the concept still lacks a dominant uniform definition (which is not atypical for such abstract terms) which only reaffirms its inability to be conformed with. For a better understanding of the concept, two solutions, though both inadequate to resolve the problem, can be proposed. If Raz tried to present conformity to the RoL as conformity to legal certainty, this should have been stated more directly and not under the (overly) generic concept of the RoL. While this definition would contribute to eliminating uncertainty, it would not contribute to defining the RoL, as it would act only as a restatement of other principles and would be essentially without its own essence. On the other hand, keeping the scope of the concept wide would distinguish the RoL from other principles but would also cause it to suffer from disproportionate conceptual uncertainty, rendering any potential prescriptive basis of the concept impossible to establish. This leads us to the fundamental problem explored by this article and to the problem pointed out by Raz himself that the RoL should not be taken blindly, on trust,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> which would be the only option when there is no clear definition.</p>

<p>As opposed to the theories discussed above, Griffith’s sceptical views destroy the concept as a whole but tend to be the most revealing. Griffith saw the RoL as essentially a political concept.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> Notwithstanding the lack of clear definition, the concept became “sacred and untouchable”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> and its special status is being maintained and reinforced by those who oppose any change of status quo – politicians.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> In addition to that,  the RoL is also a common reference made by the judiciary in their judgments; <em>Privacy International</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> being one of the most prominent examples. The Supreme Court emphasised the importance of effective judicial review in upholding the RoL and argued that the ouster clause in s.67(8) of RIPA 2000 <a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> does not disqualify the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. Nevertheless, the Court still did not fully overrule Parliament and ultimately recognised Parliament’s supremacy, stating that the ouster clause can exclude jurisdiction of judicial review when stated in “the most clear and explicit words”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> However, according to Griffith, even the judiciary uses the RoL as a fig leaf <a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> which allows them to exercise political power and should therefore not be considered as a strictly legalistic concept.</p>

<h4 id="-the-incompatibility-of-the-rule-of-law-with-the-institutional-framework-"><u> The incompatibility of the rule of law with the institutional framework </u></h4>

<p>In this section, we turn to the issue of incompatibility of the RoL as interpreted in the aforementioned accounts and as a prescriptive concept with the British institutional framework.</p>

<p>Aristotle contrasted the rule of law, as a state where rulers are constrained by laws, with the rule of individuals, as a state where rulers govern arbitrarily.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> However, we ought to question whether we can distinguish between these two alternatives in the context of the British constitutional system. Laws are made by people – whether in the form of an individual or an assembly.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> As argued by Loughlin, laws are a “human creation” and can therefore not be placed above human will or government of men. Laws are unable to rule because ruling requires action.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> Humans are needed to enforce the law and, in that way, it is them who rule <em>with</em> laws. The state is therefore both the source and the subject of law,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> which means that in practice, the lawmaker (Parliament) is not always (or does not have to be) constrained by the law because all the power to change it lies in its hands. In enacting new laws, Parliament is realistically not accountable to anyone – not even to the already existing laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> The role of the Government will be analysed in the following section.</p>

<p>The reason for this is parliamentary sovereignty. The power of the Parliament to “make or unmake any law whatever” as described by Dicey <a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> prevents the UK from having a prescriptive RoL in the sense of Bingham’s, Dicey’s and Raz’s interpretations in its legal system. Dicey provided his famous definition of parliamentary sovereignty, but also emphasised the importance of the second fundamental principle – the RoL. He argued that the two principles are not counterbalancing forces since Parliament favours the supremacy of the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> He pointed out two RoL characteristics in the British constitution: the stringent procedural requirements of the legislative process and supremacy of the law enforcing parliamentary sovereignty. The flaw of the former will be analysed in the following section whereas the issue of the latter characteristic is discussed here.</p>

<p>Dicey argued that the RoL constrains discretionary power of the government and reinforces the power of Parliament.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Indeed, we cannot claim that the government’s exercise of power is not checked. Judicial review plays an important role in the court’s scrutiny of the legality, reasonableness and procedural propriety of the executive and administrative actions but does not play an important role in the context of the RoL.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> The more appropriate concept used would be rule <em>by</em> law,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> concentrating on the executive function, which is the primary task of the government. This concept also has much stronger prescriptive value, since compliance is required directly by the courts in judicial review. However, according to Schmitt, this concept should not be equated with the RoL, since rule <em>by</em> law can be found even in an absolute monarchy, with the monarch’s will being the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> While an absolute monarchy and judicial review are not two consonant concepts, the mechanism of judicial review could potentially be established in this kind of regime with the aim of scrutinising public bodies’ execution of laws, irrespective of the fact that the laws are the will of the monarch. In this sense, the law is the essential means through which governing is administered.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> Yet, this concept alone is inadequate for guaranteeing that institutional conditions make everything, and everyone subordinate to law because parliamentary sovereignty, as the central concept in British constitution, prevents that.</p>

<p>Rule by law and the procedure of judicial review are therefore not concerned with the way the law was enacted, which occupies a dominant position in the rule <em>of</em> law. The famous <em>Entick v Carrington</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> case emphasised the notion of legality, supporting the idea of rule <em>by</em> law, but it constitutes only a part of the RoL definition, applying to the idea of implementing laws and not legislating. These laws are still not supreme on their own – as explained in the previous section, it is the Parliament that makes and unmakes them. The Government is certainly obliged to follow the laws enacted by Parliament, but their existence is very much dependent on the latter institution. Judicial review therefore scrutinises compliance with laws made by Parliament and protects laws, which ultimately protects parliamentary sovereignty;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> hence, the authority of the institution  and not the law itself. In this spirit, the power of Parliament to legislate is not limited by any principle, and therefore Parliament always prevails over the RoL. This suggests that Dicey was wrong in asserting that the RoL is a constraint on the government. The RoL should actually be considered in the relationship with the law-maker – Parliament – to find who holds the supreme authority.</p>

<p>The question arising from Dicey’s argument that parliamentary sovereignty and the RoL work hand in hand is: Can there be two supreme bodies – the body of Parliament and the body of law? Parliament undoubtedly favours supremacy of the law once the law is created, insofar as it correspondingly guarantees Parliament’s authority. If the law stops serving the purpose Parliament intended it to serve, it will create a new law or repeal old law, regardless of the legitimacy of its decision. Thus, the concept cannot be prescriptive because it is theoretically irreconcilable with the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty which allows Parliament to enact any law, even if it goes against certain RoL principles. The contemporary state of the British constitution allows us to trace the characteristics of the RoL in it but that does not mean that actors are guided by this principle or even compelled to observe it. It is important to remember that the question here is not “<em>will</em> Parliament repeal the supremacy of law, including the law over legislative procedure?” but <em>“can</em> Parliament repeal supremacy of law and change the law over its legislative procedure?” The fact that Parliament cannot bind its successors <a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> does not change the argument – the law can still be changed for at least the mandate of the Parliament in question. Similarly, Parliament can also change its procedural rules of the legislating process which will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Parliament has many times demonstrated willingness to create laws preventing citizens from damaging the state’s interests, with the RoL being evidently ignored. While the example might seem exceptional, it nevertheless portrays that Parliament <em>can</em> act contrary to the RoL. In <em>Burmah Oil Company v Lord Advocate</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> the House of Lords decided that the British Government should have compensated Burmah Oil Company for damages done on their oil fields by British soldiers during the Second World War. In response to that, Parliament enacted the War Damage Act 1965, which retrospectively exempted the UK government from liability for war-related damages. This action goes against Bingham’s and Raz’s emphasis on prospectivity in the RoL. Moreover, the 1965 Act manifests the power vested in Parliament through parliamentary sovereignty which is above the courts’ decisions and above any specific law. The constitution does not guarantee the RoL but the rule of people, with no law being above the will of humans.</p>

<h4 id="-the-rule-of-law-in-the-context-of-the-modern-political-system-"><u> The rule of law in the context of the modern political system </u></h4>

<p>In this section, the article will explore the use of the RoL as a political slogan and discuss the impossibility of embedding the RoL in Britain’s political structure.</p>

<p>The British constitution is based on the Westminster model. While power is divided into three branches of government, the traditional notion of the separation of powers, as proposed by Montesquieu, <a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> does not apply in the UK political context.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> The Westminster Model in reality blurs the line between the legislative and executive branch. As a result, the party with the majority in the House of Commons both forms the government and also dominates the legislative process.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> Because of parliamentary sovereignty, the executive gains <em>de facto</em> sovereignty through its dual role in the legislative branch. The ruler is effectively also the legislator. It is true that a bill must go through the amending process of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, but in reality, the executive has proven to be well equipped to achieve its goals through procedural obstacles or even by modifying such obstacles. One example is the Parliament Act 1911.</p>

<p>In 1911, Lloyd George’s Liberal government proposed the Parliament Bill, which downgraded the power of the House of Lords in the legislative process. While all procedural requirements were observed in enacting the 1911 Act, the government clearly pressured the House of Lords to give their consent to the Act for their political purposes of developing social welfare.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> This is a primary example of the power of the executive changing the procedural laws when those do not serve them, without needing to perform a coup d’état. Contrary to Dicey’s theory which emphasised that the RoL is maintained by procedural safeguards in the process of legislating,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> the procedure did not provide any safeguard in this case. Since the Liberals and the coalition prevailed with their votes in the House of Commons and the Lords were passing the bill under a threat from the king to reconfigure the House, the goal of removing procedural backstops for all the future law-making was achieved purely through political conduits. In this sense, any law could be modified according to the wish of the ruling party, even if the change entailed major implications for legislative process and the structure of Parliament by, as Baroness Hale said: “redefining [Parliament] downwards”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> The RoL is impotent in a battle with the rule of people. It was the laws that were adapted to the government’s position and not the government’s position adapted to the laws. It must be noted that while this is not an everyday occurrence, it is these rare cases that demonstrate our legal reality and how state actors are allowed to exercise their powers in practice.</p>

<p>This observation leads us to exploring the RoL as a protection from arbitrariness, as emphasised by Raz.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> According to Schmitt, in the RoL, a legal norm should be distinguishable from the rule of persons “whether it is an individual person, an assembly, or body whose will takes the place of a general norm that is equal for all and determined in advance”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Even though the alterations in the Parliament Act 1911 were proposed by the government (and not one single dictator), its enactment still contradicts Raz’s premise of protection from arbitrariness. Raz acknowledged the extent of power given to the government by law and proposed the RoL as a procedural safeguard against the danger of arbitrariness.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> Even though the Parliament Act went through all the stages of the legislative process and was therefore not arbitrarily made, substantive arbitrariness of the Government’s pursuit of its agenda permeated through the safeguards and nothing like the RoL prevents a similar enactment from taking place again. While the institutional conditions may protect the integrity of the system of rules,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> this protection is not always guaranteed, and certainly not via the concept of the RoL.</p>

<h4 id="-looking-towards-the-future-"><u> Looking towards the future </u></h4>

<p>The concept remains ill-defined and vulnerable to potential abuses. That is why the RoL, as a prescriptive concept, should be removed from common use by both politicians and the judiciary. It should only be explored together with other abstract principles and aspirations promising a better and more just tomorrow (at least until a more uniform definition is found). Nevertheless, in its current state, the RoL cannot provide that. On the contrary, making false pretences and creating the impression of fictitious protection is precarious and threatens the permeation of arbitrariness and dictatorial regime into the British legal system.</p>

<p>Alternatively, in order to make the concept suitable for concrete use not only in political but also legal context, Parliament could consider codifying the RoL in an Act of Parliament and providing a uniform definition. By converting it into valid law, the institutions of the state would be legally obliged to follow the principle. Nevertheless, this solution should be recognised as defective for two reasons: firstly, there is no guarantee that this Act of Parliament would have longevity due to the no entrenchment rule. Secondly, the lack of uniform definition and the inherent vagueness both stand as major barriers on the path towards codification. Also, the fact that other legal principles possibly covered by the RoL, such as legal certainty and prospectivity, are to a great extent observed by lawmakers, the umbrella term of the RoL appears to be redundant in the context of the British constitution.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>This article has demonstrated that the reason for the RoL being repeatedly violated and yet not being properly condemned or even judicially sanctioned is that the concept does not play any substantial role in the British constitutional regime. In fact, it does not really exist in the prescriptive sense. The RoL is desperately deprived of a concrete definition, which renders it unsuitable to be incorporated into the system as one of the constitutional principles. Moreover, the concept can only be recognised in a descriptive form while still being greatly incompatible with institutions of British constitution and being circumvented or even abused in the political context. The safest option for both the legal system and citizens would be to remove it altogether from our legal and political structure. Nevertheless, it appears to be much too useful for creating vagueness and false impression of untouchability of laws to be forgotten so easily.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <h5 id="introduction">Introduction </h5>

<p>The invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in the advent of the <em>Schrems II</em> case raises a plethora of concerns for the UK’s free flow of data to the European Economic Area (EEA) post-Brexit. With the instant invalidation of the Privacy Shield agreement relied upon by over 5000 corporations within the EU and the US<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a>, transborder data flows have been severely affected as a result of mandating heightened data protection assessments when transferring data out of the EU. This blog piece aims to analyse the <em>Schrems II</em> case and its application to the UK’s current data protection regime to determine if the UK will be granted an ‘adequacy status’. It will assess the UK’s legislative responses to jurisprudence from the Court of Justice of the European Union and discuss how these may act as impediments which prevent the European Commission from reaching an adequacy decision. Finally, this article will evaluate the implications of not being granted an ‘adequacy status’ on the UK’s transborder data flows to the EU upon the expiry of the transition period.    </p>

<h5 id="1-what-is-an-adequacy-status-and-why-does-it-matter">1) What is an ‘adequacy status’ and why does it matter? </h5>

<p>An ‘adequacy status’ is granted by the European Commission to non-EU countries – which are known as third countries wishing to have free and unimpeded data flow within the European Economic Area. It is granted when a third country’s data protection regime is deemed to provide a level of protection which is ‘essentially  equivalent’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> to EU law. In evaluating the third country’s legal regime, the European Commission looks at, <em>inter alia</em>, the extent to which the rule of law respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, the means of judicial redress afforded to data subjects and the effective functioning of an independent supervisory authority enforcing compliance with data protection rules.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></p>

<p>With the UK becoming a ‘third country’ vis-à-vis the EU, not being granted an adequacy status by the European Commission would result in companies having to resort to alternative methods of legal compliance under the GDPR. Therefore, analysing the legislative frameworks pertaining to the UK in light of <em>Schrems II</em> will allow for the extrapolation of whether such frameworks might be deemed adequate by the European Commission. </p>

<p>Analysing whether the UK will be granted an adequacy status also matters in the context of the UK being provided with a six month interim period by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> which stipulates terms on which the EU and the UK will trade following the end of the implementation period on the 31st of December. The Agreement provides that for an interim period lasting 6 months (from the 1st of January 2021), data flows from the EEA to the UK will not be considered as transfers to a third country under EU law. Therefore, the UK has an additional 6 months to ensure that their data protection laws are fully compatible with <em>Schrems II</em> upon the expiry of the interim period.  </p>

<h5 id="2-will-the-uk-be-granted-an-adequacy-status-in-light-ofschrems-ii">2) Will the UK be granted an ‘adequacy status’ in light of <em>Schrems II</em>? </h5>

<p>The <em>Schrems II</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> case arose following the CJEU’s invalidation of the Safe Harbour Agreement in <em>Schrems I</em> in 2015 and concerned a complaint against Facebook. Privacy advocate Max Schrems contended that US surveillance schemes processing data transferred from Facebook Ireland Ltd. to its parent company in the US, Facebook Inc. conflicts with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the rights enshrined in the European Charter of Human Rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> While <em>Schrems II</em> was concerned with surveillance schemes adopted by US security agencies and their nonconformity with EU law, the principles elucidated by the CJEU can shed light as to whether an adequacy decision might be granted to the UK.</p>

<h6 id="grounds-for-the-invalidation-of-the-eu-us-privacy-shield"><u>Grounds for the Invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield</u> </h6>

<p>In <em>Schrems II</em>, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated on two grounds. </p>

<h6 id="a-the-mass-surveillance-of-data-by-us-agencies"><u>(a) The mass surveillance of data by US Agencies</u></h6>

<p>The mass surveillance of data by section 702 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Executive Order 12333 permit the collection of information from EU data subjects in bulk to obtain foreign intelligence information. In <em>Schrems II</em>, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that the surveillance of EU data has not been limited to what is strictly necessary<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> thus breaching the principle of proportionality.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> In particular, the CJEU ruled that Art. 7 and 8 of the Charter<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> stipulating the right to private and family life and protection of personal data respectively were violated as the interference with EU data subjects’ rights and freedoms for national security purposes “go beyond the restrictions necessary in a democratic society”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a>   </p>

<p>Applying this to the UK, it is questionable whether UK national security and surveillance law is proportionate to its restrictions. A historical chronology of the development of UK legislative frameworks on surveillance would further illustrate this.                    </p>

<h6 id="requirements-for-data-interception-under-the-investigatory-powers-act"><em>Requirements for Data Interception under the Investigatory Powers Act</em></h6>

<p>Following the enactment of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) in 2014, the <em>Tele2/Watson</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> case challenging UK and Swedish data retention laws concluded that the DRIPA framework does not comply with the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58. In particular, the court held that DRIPA’s legislative framework breached the requirement of retaining data to prevent a “serious risk” to public security and permitted warrants for bulk acquisition of data without notifying individuals that their data was being accessed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Three criteria can be extracted from the CJEU judgment on how DRIPA had to be reformed to comply with the e-Privacy Directive:<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>     </p>

<p>(i)           Security Intelligence Agencies (SIAs) must access metadata for a narrow set of purposes </p>

<p>(ii)          Prior independent review must take place before authorising data interception</p>

<p>(iii)         Data acquisition/retention must be proportionate and targeted towards specific data subjects who must be informed of their data being processed  </p>

<p>Arguably, the first criteria has been addressed because a narrow set of purposes has been stipulated in the IPA about metadata that can be retained by SIAs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> An exhaustive list has been added to the IPA whereby processing must be justified according to one of six purposes including “interests of national security” and an “applicable crime purpose”. The second criterion has been also addressed through the IPA by introducing a “double lock” for the interception of warrants whereby warrants/notices must be approved by the Secretary of State and subsequently by the Investigatory Powers Commission prior to being authorised for use in data retention.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> This introduced a more robust framework for authorising the use of warrants for data interception.    </p>

<p>However, the third criteria extrapolated from the judgement has not been met as the Act stipulates that the Secretary of State’s power to authorise a warrant would be considered proportionate as long as data retention is justified according to one of six purposes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> This fails to ensure that data retention is targeted to certain data subjects or a specific class of individuals whose data must be processed according to the justified purpose.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> This is analogous to s.702 FISA discussed in <em>Schrems II</em> where data retention was not targeted and consequently found to be disproportionate. It is therefore clear that both the US and UK data protection SIAs use “national security” as a blanket defence for disproportionate processing of data in bulk. Furthermore, s.174 of the IPA makes it an offence for telecommunication providers to disclose to any person, “without reasonable excuse”, the contents of a warrant.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> The Act potentially implies that informing data subjects of their data being processed is an offence unless authorised by the Secretary of State. This will likely act as an impediment to being granted an adequacy status as the legislation’s default position should be informing data subjects unless there is a legitimate reason not to. </p>

<p>In light of the previous analysis which highlights that the IPA framework fails to ensure proportionate data acquisition that is transparently disclosed to all affected data subjects, the response of the minister of State for Media and Data<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> to the questions posed by the European Scrutiny Committee is concerning. By praising the IPA as “robust, transparent and world-leading”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a>, Sir William Cash MP seems give too much merit to the UK legislative framework given the third criterion from the <em>Tele2/Watson</em> judgement that has not been addressed.</p>

<h6 id="national-security-considerations-in-the-investigatory-powers-act"><em>National Security Considerations in the Investigatory Powers Act</em> </h6>

<p>The IPA framework has been deemed indiscriminate and disproportionate for protecting national security in the <em>Privacy International</em> case.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> In the case, Privacy International, a UK based charity defending rights to privacy bought a case before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the UK Security<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> and Intelligence<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Agencies challenging the legality of processing bulk communications within the IPA framework due to not being compliant with the E-Privacy Directive and not fully addressing issues identified by <em>Tele2/Watson. </em>However, the UK government argued that the E-privacy Directive does not apply to its processing activities as according to Art.4(2) of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a>, “national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state”. Since processing occurred for national security purposes, the UK government argued that the E-Privacy Directive does not apply due to national security falling outside the competency of EU law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> While the CJEU focused on whether EU law has primacy over data processing in the context of national security,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> it also considered whether general and indiscriminate retention of data is permissible under national security purposes as a secondary point. </p>

<p>Regarding the question of whether national security falls within the competence of EU law, the CJEU ruled that while it is the responsibility of Member States to determine their own security measures, such measures must be in accordance with EU law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> However, in <em>Schrems II</em>, the CJEU precluded the application of Art.4(2) TEU to the US legal regime as the US is not an EU Member State.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Therefore, while both <em>Schrems II </em>and <em>Privacy International </em>concerned data processing in the context of ‘national security’, it is clear that the UK government availed of the applicability of the TEU to exclude the disproportionate processing of bulk data by SIAs from the scope of EU law. This, however, will no longer be the case because the UK can no longer take advantage of TEU following the expiry of the transition period. </p>

<p>However, the CJEU in <em>Privacy International </em>affirmed the applicability of EU law to SIAs processing activities and reiterate what has been discussed in the <em>Schrems II</em> CJEU judgement regarding general and indiscriminate data collection by SIAs for national security purposes, whereby data processing must be proportionate, strictly necessary and targeted according to Art. 15(1) of the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> Therefore, while <em>Privacy International</em> did not evaluate the substantive flaws of the IPA framework, analysing it in conjunction with <em>Schrems II</em> affirms that more robust safeguards for data subjects in the context of national security must be put in place for the UK and the US to be deemed to provide a level of protection “essentially equivalent” to EU law. Contextualising this with <em>Tele2/Watson </em>shows that the IPA framework must address the criteria extracted from the judgment for Sir William Cash MP to describe the IPA as “robust, transparent and world-leading”.</p>

<h6 id="considerations-under-the-eu-uk-trade-agreement"><em>Considerations under the EU-UK Trade Agreement</em> </h6>

<p>It is vital to draw to attention that Article FINPROV.10A of the EU-UK Trade Agreement<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> stipulates that if the UK changes its data protection law for reasons other than complying with the EU data protection regime, the interim period automatically comes to an end and the UK becomes a third country vis-à-vis the EU. It is arguable that through this provision, the UK is promising not to use bulk interception of data for national security reasons as the incompatibility of this with EU law has been affirmed through CJEU jurisprudence in <em>Privacy International</em>. Nevertheless, the UK agreeing not to use bulk interception of data is not enough for being granted an adequacy finding upon the expiry of such period.  </p>

<p>Therefore, it is concluded that in order to ensure that the processing of data is proportionate and strictly necessary according to <em>Schrems II</em>, the IPA must address the substantive issues raised in <em>Tele2/Watson </em>by ensuring that data retention is proportionate and targeted, whilst safeguarding data subjects’ by making them fully aware of their data being processed. Hence, at its current form, the IPA framework is not fully “robust, transparent and world-leading”. With the interim period ending on the 1st of July and no reforms being enacted, both judgements read in light of <em>Schrems II </em>present a major setback for the UK obtaining an adequacy decision (pursuant to Art. 45, GDPR).      </p>

<h6 id="bmeans-for-judicial-redress"><u>(b)  Means for Judicial Redress</u></h6>

<p>The second ground as to why the EU-US Privacy Shield was nullified relates to insufficient means for judicial redress. The creation of the Ombudsperson under the Privacy Shield was declared insufficient by the CJEU because individuals are not able to bring legal action before an impartial and independent court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> The CJEU justified this point by stating that the “ombudsperson is appointed by the Secretary of State and is an integral part of the US State Department”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a>thereby alluding to the fact that the judicial body (ombudsperson) is not free from the pressure of the executive. This is detrimental to the impartiality of the ombudsperson who is not able to exert autonomy when making judgements. Furthermore, the CJEU state that although recital 120 of the Privacy Shield agreement stipulates the commitment of the US Government to ensuring that the “Privacy Shield Ombudsperson” corrects violations from SIAs, no provision in the agreement affirms or indicates the “power” of the ombudsperson to adopt decisions that are legally binding on SIAs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> In light of these issues, the CJEU ruled that the level of protection afforded by the ombudsperson is not “essentially equivalent” to EU law which enshrines a “right to an effective remedy and fair trial” through Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> As such, two criteria can be extracted from the <em>Schrems II</em> case that must be met for the UK to be granted an adequacy status: (1) that the judicial body responsible for data surveillance issues must be independent and impartial and (2) that the judicial body must have the power to issue legally binding decisions. </p>

<p>Starting with the first criteria, it is clear that an independent tribunal, specifically, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has been exclusively empowered to hear complaints against the regime and provide redress. This is affirmed through the case of <em>Big Brothers Watch v UK</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> which concerned, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the IPT complies with Article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Since the convention has been woven into EU jurisprudence through the European Charter of Human Rights<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a>, the case provides salient observations on the impartiality of the IPT. The ECtHR ruled that the IPT functions as an independent body and that hosting meetings with Security Services such as MI5 does not undermine the tribunal’s impartiality insofar as fairness, justice and procedural regularity for court hearings are concerned.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> The ECtHR additionally ruled that the tribunal is exempt from having public hearings in instances where information disclosed from parties pertains to national security and that this does not infringe on the transparency of the tribunal and thus its impartiality in the eyes of the public.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a></p>

<p>Moving to the second criteria, the ability of the IPT to issue legally binding decisions against the executive branch (i.e. government) is evidenced through the case of <em>Liberty</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a>. The IPT ruled in the case that Article 8 and Article 10 of the ECHR enshrining the right to private and family life and the right to freedom of expression respectively have not been “in accordance with the law”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> as necessary in a democratic society and have thus been violated. <em>Liberty</em> was the first case ruled by the IPT that was found against the government and proved that the judicial framework for redress is more effective than the ombudsperson mechanism in the US as the executive branch can be held accountable when contravening the law. The effectiveness of the IPT in being able to challenge the executive is furthermore demonstrated in the case of <em>Belhadj &amp; Others</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> where Security Services’ surveillance schemes (operating under the auspices of the government) were found to contravene the Regulation of the Investigatory Powers Act 2000.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a></p>

<p>Another indication that does not directly fall within the <em>Schrems II </em>independent tribunal criteria but could act as an advantage for the UK being granted an adequacy is section 242 of the Investigatory Powers Act 2018,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> which allows parties to appeal from decisions concluded in the IPT to the Court of Appeal. This domestic route of appeal ostensibly provides individuals with further access to judicial redress which is a promising step towards the UK being granted an adequacy decision.    </p>

<p>As such, the UK has an effective judicial redress framework and this could act as an advantage when the European Commission considers granting the adequacy status.   </p>

<h5 id="3-what-if-the-uk-is-not-granted-an-adequacy-status">3) What if the UK is not granted an ‘adequacy status’? </h5>

<p>If the UK is not granted an ‘adequacy status’, companies wishing to import/export data from the EEA must resort to alternative methods of legal compliance such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> The case holds that companies using SCCs must implement additional safeguards by assessing SCCs on a case-by-case basis in context of the third country’s legal regime.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> Despite the ICO amending the SCC template following <em>Schrems II</em> to maximise protection by design,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> corporations do not have any guidelines as to how they can assess data exports. This creates practical difficulties for UK corporations relying on SCCs (in the event of no adequacy being granted) as they are obliged by the <em>Schrems II</em> judgement to revisit their terms to establish a comprehensive framework not undermining data subjects’ rights under Art. 44,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> albeit with no guidelines from the ICO on how such protection can be fulfilled.  With such an onerous burden, corporations will likely apply divergent levels of understanding when assessing data exports which runs the risk of not achieving the wider GDPR policy objective of data protection. However, the severity of this burden in light of the <em>Schrems II </em>case remains unaffected in the context of UK companies as firstly, the UK will not be regarded as a third country during the six-month interim period according to the EU-UK Trade Agreement and secondly, the UK legislature has transposed GDPR laws locally through the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications statutory instrument<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> which mirrors the GDPR and thus evidences the UK’s continued compliance with EU law and jurisprudence in <em>Schrems II</em>.</p>

<p>Given the fact that BCRs create legally binding internal rules for data transfers approved by a data protection authority in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR, they are seen as a more feasible and durable method of alternative legal compliance due to not being subject to the same protective standard applied to SCCs in <em>Schrems II</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> UK companies relying on BCRs enjoy a greater deal of flexibility as the competent supervisory authority does not need to evidence ‘non-material updates to BCRs’ thus saving time and costs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> However, it should be noted that BCRs are not practically useful as they exclusively apply to data transfers within a corporate group.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> The practical utility of BCRs may thus be limited because they cannot enable wider data transfers outside the corporate groups. </p>

<p>Art. 49 derogations<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> are an alternative method of legal compliance that can be applied to a very limited set of circumstances and can be used when SCCs or BCRs cannot be utilised. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) applies stringent criteria when authorising data transfers under Art. 49 derogations whereby the transborder transfer of data must be strictly necessary for one of seven derogations recognised by the EBDP.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> For instance, if the derogation relied upon is “necessary for the performance of a contract”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> the EBDP must establish, <em>inter alia</em>, a “close and substantial connection between the transfer and purpose of the contract”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> The stringent criteria applied by the EBDP when authorising data transfers under Art.49 derogations indicate that they must be used as a last resort and are thus not of practical utility to firms in the event of no adequacy being granted.   </p>

<p>Hence, it seems SCCs  are the only option which corporations can rely on for data transfers to the EEA in the event of no adequacy being granted; although their application remains highly uncertain in light of <em>Schrems II</em>.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>This blog piece aims to shed light on the implications of the <em>Schrems II </em>case on post-Brexit data flows in the context of cases decided by the CJEU that highlight areas that must undergo legislative reform to ensure an adequacy status is granted.  Since the interim period stipulated in the EU-UK Trade Agreement is due to expire on the 1st of July, the UK parliament has a six-month period through which it must urgently enact legislative reforms following issues raised in <em>Schrems II</em> concerning proportionality of data processing as well as issues regarding indiscriminate retention of bulk data and the lack of safeguards in the IPA framework according to <em>Privacy International</em> and <em>Tele2/Watson</em> to ensure an adequacy status is granted. It is concluded that in the event of no adequacy being granted upon the expiry of the interim period, companies seeking unencumbered EU-UK data flows must rely on alternative methods of legal compliance. Given the narrow transfer of data within the remit of BCRs and the stringent criteria applied to Art. 49 derogations which must be used as a last resort, companies have no choice but to rely on SCCs which create onerous burdens on firms given the lack of guidance from data protection authorities including the ICO.</p>

	     <h5 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h5>

<p>Scientific research suggests that the implementation of artificial wombs for human fetuses (ectogenesis) is foreseeable within the next few decades,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> having already been used successfully for lamb fetuses.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> However, the current law is ill-equipped to deal with the conflict of rights which will ensue. Ectogenesis will reshape pre-natal viability and procedures, decreasing the mortality rate of extremely premature fetuses. As such, it will have a direct impact on the stage at which a fetus is deemed to be viable.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> Under the current law, viability is an important criterion for criminalising the termination of an unborn fetus. This article focuses on how Artificial Womb Technology (AWT) may limit the right to abortion. Furthermore, it will argue that reform is required to rebalance the maternal/fetal interest in abortion law, specifically focusing on how future legislation should classify AWT in order to restore the doctrine of viability.</p>

<p>While this article recognises that abortion is an ethically-charged issue, it does not aim to discuss the ethical implications of abortion. Instead, it will focus on proposing a solution to ensure that the right to abortion is protected in the advent of AWT, and to shed light on an impending dilemma with huge legal implications on the current application of abortion laws.</p>

<h5 id="ii-the-offence-of-child-destruction">II. The Offence of Child Destruction</h5>

<p>Section 1(1) of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother, shall be guilty… of child destruction.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst originally this was not intended to be concerned with abortion,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> it is now accepted that an unlawful abortion could fall within the scope of this offence. In <em>C v S</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> a putative father challenged the potential abortion of his unborn child. The courts contemplated whether an abortion would constitute a criminal offence under the IL(P)A 1929. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal found that the child was not capable of being born alive, and the doctor would thus not be guilty of the offence. The extensive and detailed judicial application of the aspects of the born alive test in this case indicate that the courts did not preclude the possibility that the offence (under the IL(P)A 1929) could apply to abortion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a></p>

<p>The applicability of child destruction to unlawful abortion was confirmed in <em>Rance v Mid-Downs Health Authority</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Brooke J, in determining whether an abortion of a disabled fetus was lawful, stated that the abortion would be “prima facie rendered lawful under… the Act of 1967, provided it did not involve the destruction of the life of a child ‘capable of being born alive,’ contrary to section 1 of the Act of 1929”.<a class="inline-reference" d="inline8" href="#8">8</a> He applied the born alive test stating that “The question of mixed fact and law” is whether the fetus  “would have been a child capable of being born alive”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> Whilst the fetus was not found to meet this threshold, Brooke J’s application of the test evidences that an unlawful abortion could fall within the scope of the child destruction offence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a></p>

<p>Further evidence of the applicability of child destruction to abortion was given in a Parliamentary debate in 1988. Lord Skelmersdale expressed the notion that “because of the interaction between” the IL(P)A and the Abortion Act (AA) 1967,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#11">11</a> child destruction has evolved into a possible prosecutorial tool against unlawful abortion by placing “a de facto limit below which a doctor performing an abortion has the benefit of an automatic defence.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Essentially, the offence of child destruction catches any procedures which fall outside of the AA 1967’s criteria.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the AA 1967 supports the notion that the offence of child destruction is still relevant today. Section 5 states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“(1) No offence under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 shall be committed by a registered medical practitioner who terminates a pregnancy in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) For the purposes of the law relating to abortion, anything done with intent to procure a woman’s miscarriage … is unlawfully done unless authorised by section 1 of this Act”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, the AA 1967 restricts the scope of the offence of child destruction but does not replace it. It indicates the offence is still very much relevant to abortion if the procedure is performed outside of the conditions provided by Section 1.  Accordingly, when Section 5 was inserted into the AA 1967 in 1990, Parliament made the express decision to retain child destruction’s applicability to abortion. Thus, the IL(P)A 1929 implies that a viable fetus has an interest in life, which may only be circumscribed in the circumstances provided by paragraphs (b) to (d) of S1(1) AA 1967.</p>

<p>Strangely, the Abortion Act never became the sole authority on abortion by replacing the IL(P)A, especially considering the intermission between the latter and the enactment and amendments to the former. Romanis argues that this was a deliberate decision by the legislature.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> This is an ostensible indication of Parliament’s intention to continue to criminalise the abortion of viable fetuses, by, in theory, not instating the Abortion Act as the sole authority, but essentially as a <strong>defence</strong> to child destruction. Evidence of this ‘deliberate decision’ can be demonstrated in a 1988 debate rejecting the report of a Select Committee which suggested the IL(P)A’s ‘born alive’ test be disengaged from Section 5(1) of the AA 1967.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Lord Robertson fervently objected to this, asserting that “a cardinal principle is that abortion should not be allowed where the child is capable of being born alive.” <a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> He suggested that the AA 1967’s viability threshold is meant to serve as an “upper limit”, and thus to depart from the IL(P)A’s test was “wrong”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Therefore, Romanis is well-founded in her argument that the legislature deliberately maintained the distinction between the two Acts.</p>

<p>In plain, the offence of child destruction seems to affirm the importance of the viability doctrine within English law. The purpose of criminalising the abortion of a viable fetus is, <em>prima facie</em>, the protection of the fetus. Accordingly, a maternal/fetal balance can be observed as an interest of the law. </p>

<h5 id="iii-the-right-to-abortion">III. The Right to Abortion</h5>

<p>In contrast, the right to abortion protects a woman’s autonomy and has been recognised as a fundamental right in many states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> The <em>Roe v Wade</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> decision in the United States is an illustration of this - the Supreme Court recognised that abortion was within the constitutional right of privacy, stating that “the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a></p>

<p>Under  English law, the AA 1967 legalises abortion in a broad range of circumstances provided in Section 1(1)(a)-(d): when it is clear that continuing the pregnancy involves risk to the woman, which must become even graver after the twenty-four week threshold, or that the fetus suffers from severe abnormalities. The legality of abortion in these circumstances essentially provides a defence to the child destruction offence under the IL(P)A 1929.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is a well-established principle that the fetus has no legal personhood, under any circumstances, before birth.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> In <em>Paton v British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> the court held that, as a matter grounded in common law, “The foetus cannot… have a right of its own at least until it is born and has a separate existence from its mother”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>However, after viability, which is the point from which the fetus is developed enough to live “indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> the IL(P)A 1929 implies that a fetus gains  an interest to be born by imposing criminal sanctions on its killing, providing the fetus with what is possibly the only legal protection it will receive pre-birth.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, some academics argue that abortion is not a right in the UK, instead, it is merely a procedure that can take place if the correct medical criteria (set out in Section 1 of the AA 1967) are met.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> The weight of this argument is reinforced by the aforementioned criminalisation of any abortion performed outside of the context of the AA 1967. Nevertheless, such a viewpoint ostensibly discounts the importance of human rights jurisprudence, which indicates that access to abortion is gradually evolving into a positive right.</p>

<p>For instance, the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that access to legal abortion is linked to the right to private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In <em>Tysiąc v Poland,</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> the court held that a state cannot escape a procedural obligation to make abortion available where the law allows it. Whilst this is a development in Strasbourg’s abortion jurisprudence from the decision of <em>Brüggemann and Scheuten v Germany</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> which held that a woman’s choice with her pregnancy is not concerned with Article 8, it focuses on the procedural aspects of the law, and suggests that Strasbourg is reserved in deciding “substantive violations” of abortion as a fundamental right.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> In <em>Tysiąc</em>, the court accepted that a state cannot prohibit abortion for therapeutic reasons (to protect the mother’s life). Here, the state still owes procedural safeguards due to its “measures affecting fundamental human rights”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> However, it was asserted that “once the legislature decides to allow abortion, it must not structure its legal framework in a way which would limit real possibilities to obtain it”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Strasbourg’s stance, therefore, affirms “that women’s right to access legal abortion may not be illusory”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> but for now is unprepared to address any substantive issues of abortion.</p>

<p>Accordingly, abortion is a right which is becoming increasingly recognised by law. This could be threatened if English law cannot keep pace with the technological advancements in the field of neonatal care.</p>

<h5 id="iv-implications-of-artificial-womb-technology">IV. Implications of Artificial Womb Technology</h5>

<h5 id="iva-the-change-in-viability-and-the-effect-on-criminalisation"><em>IV(a). The change in viability and the effect on criminalisation</em></h5>

<h6 id="iimpact-ofawt-on-the-viability-doctrine"><u>(i).  Impact of  AWT on the viability doctrine</u></h6>

<p>AWT will inevitably have implications on the doctrine of viability. Viability is a seemingly blurred concept as a judicial tool,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> yet tries to classify fetal status upon which the legality of an abortion is usually based. In the UK, the AA 1967 places viability at twenty-four weeks, before which most abortions should take place to avoid prosecution. However, the real question of viability is naturally much more nuanced, and each case has its own subtleties which make a certain answer almost impossible.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a></p>

<p>AWT would further impede this because a fetus would reach viability before the AA 1967’s twenty-four week threshold in the sense that “if removed, it could fully gestate” within ectogenesis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> To that end, Parliament might consider removing the threshold as it will no longer be an accurate reflection of viability. While this may appear speculative, it seems a likely course of action considering that AWT will destabilise the current understanding of viability which is integral to abortion law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> Accordingly, the retention of any quantitative measure of viability will become very difficult where an embryo could be deemed viable from conception. Furthermore, unless Parliament can find another way to balance the rights of the mother and fetus without the doctrine of viability, which risks being made obsolete by AWT, it is possible that they will elect to retain the pre-existing ‘capable of being born alive’ test under the IL(P)A 1929. This is again likely due to the discretionary nature of the test, which may allow the question of viability in the era of AWT to be dealt with by the scientific understanding at the time. As many academics have agreed, “there is not a sufficient replacement for the standard of viability” and any possible alternatives “are flawed” in the absence of abortion jurisprudence not based upon viability.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Consequently, the most desirable solution to this dilemma would be to somehow retain viability, or the balance of interests would shift entirely to the mother or fetus, undercutting the temporal compromise that the law has endeavoured to achieve.</p>

<h6 id="iiwill-the-ilpascapable-of-being-born-alive-threshold-limit-access-to-abortion-if-awt-is-deemed-a-factor-of-viability"><u>(ii).  Will the IL(P)A's  'capable of being born alive threshold' limit access to abortion if AWT is deemed a factor of viability?</u></h6>

<p>If Parliament opts to retain the ‘born alive’ test, it will be deleterious to abortion access. Fetal viability would be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on factors such as abnormalities. The lack of a clear and quantitative threshold would naturally leave the question of viability to the courts unless Parliament expressly rejected viability as a judicial tool upon the advent of AWT. As Sir John Donaldson MR stated in <em>C v S</em>, the IL(P)A test, whilst being subject to medical evidence, “essentially depends upon the interpretation of the statute and is a matter for the courts”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> However, increased judicial discretion would render courts the gatekeeper to abortion. Judges are not medical professionals and often rely on medical evidence, which would suggest that a fetus is always ‘capable of being born alive’ with AWT. Therefore, women would have no time to reflect on the reasons (financial or otherwise) for which they may seek an abortion (after previously having twenty-four weeks) before abortion is criminalised under the IL(P)A. With over 99% of abortions taking place within the limits set by the current AA 1967 twenty-four week viability threshold,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> this would substantially limit access to abortion.  Appropriately, this may be averse to fetal interests as well, as mandating a woman to give birth on account of viability regardless of her reasons for seeking abortion could have negative effects on the quality of the child’s upbringing. </p>

<p>If AWT becomes an admissible factor of viability in a judicial context, it will criminalise a substantial amount of abortions, for the reasons stated above. This could represent a shift in the law of abortion, from being rooted in feminist theory, to having a pro-life stance, and is a further reason that a solution must be obtained to address the pending legal concerns of AWT. This may be obviated should AWT be inadmissible as evidence of viability, and this idea will be developed further in this paper.</p>

<h5 id="ivb-the-socioeconomic-implications-of-limited-access-to-abortion"><em>IV(b). The socioeconomic implications of limited access to abortion</em></h5>

<p>As it has been identified, the current application of viability in the context of AWT will become obsolete, and its retention may substantially limit access to abortion. Therefore, AWT is far from settling the abortion debate. Accordingly, Schultz believes that in the U.S., where some States are hostile towards abortion, the expedition of viability may give them an opportunity to “dramatically limit abortion” under its current application.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> Whilst there is no evidence that the UK will intentionally act in the same way, it is necessary to address the implications of limiting abortion.</p>

<p>The law desires a balance between maternal and fetal interest. However, with AWT, the balance would tip towards the fetus, which not only comprises issues of autonomy, but other socioeconomic factors. Women seek abortions for a variety of reasons: For example, a study identified that 40% of women (the highest portion) sought abortion for financial reasons.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> If a woman without the means to raise a child is denied abortion as a result of AWT’s expediated viability, “implications for the well-being of their offspring” may arise,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> such as financial hardship during childhood, development issues caused by a lack of parental affection and more.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a></p>

<p>Although a common counter-argument is that women desiring abortion would have the option to gestate ex-utero for adoption, a woman may actually seek abortion to avoid genetic motherhood and “rid herself of the burden” of knowing she has an existing child.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> It is also strange that whilst AWT will affect the theoretical viability of the fetus and have the effect of limiting abortion access, many women would not have the financial means to access AWT. Thus, the limit they may face to abortion access is based upon an unachievable standard of viability. </p>

<p>Another important point is that abortions will occur unsafely if they are unduly limited. <a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> This will undoubtedly lead to a lot of expense in treating complications from unsafe abortion, which is estimated to affect around 20-50% of women who have one.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a></p>

<p>Clearly then, the law must change to attempt to reconcile the balance of maternal/fetal rights in the face of an endangered viability doctrine. However, if a meaningful viability mechanism cannot be retained, this balance becomes extremely difficult and the law will most likely tilt to either a feminist or pro-life stance. </p>

<h5 id="ivc-the-legal-status-of-fetuses"><em>IV(c). The legal status of fetuses</em></h5>

<p>It is a well-established common law principle that legal personhood is crystallised at birth.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> Therefore, the right to life under Article 2 of the ECHR does not extend to a fetus;<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> an interpretation not without contention. For example, Judge Mularoni’s dissent in <em>Vo v France</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> asserted that a lack of personhood should not disqualify all recognition and protection for the fetus’ right to life.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> She draws upon the <em>Oviedo Convention </em>to substantiate her point<em>, </em>which regulates the use of potential prenatal genetic modifications and wider misuse of biotechnology in order to protect the interests and dignity “of everyone, including the unborn”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> This suggests that the unborn does not necessarily lack protections associated with a right to life. Her argument is convincing, as it highlights that there is a propensity to ‘cherry-pick’ when the unborn is protected, e.g. not against abortion but against the misuse of biotechnology.  Nevertheless, a distinction should be made that in an abortion context, a conflict of rights would arise were the fetus given a right to life against the mother’s autonomy. Meanwhile, in terms of the protection that Oviedo supplies (against biotechnological abuse), there is no clash of rights between the unborn and any immediate person. </p>

<p>Accordingly, if a fetus were to be given legal personhood, the right to abortion could be sidestepped completely. Despite this, Romanis has correctly identified that if a fetus is extracted from the womb to be placed into an artificial womb, it has been born by the definition of birth under Section 41 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, which is “a child born alive”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> As a fetus placed into ectogenesis will not be dead, this definition will have been fulfilled, possibly affording it legal personhood. This would be the first instance in which a gestating fetus would have personhood under the law. Some believe that this is justified, as Colgrove asserts that fetuses taken from the womb to be placed within ectogenesis “are newborns (although very young ones)”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> Nevertheless, to give personhood to a fetus being placed into AWT would eliminate the mother’s ability to terminate the pregnancy without committing infanticide. This poses the question as to whether a woman’s autonomy and choice to abort should extend to when the fetus is no longer the subject of her womb, which seems foreign to the ‘my body, my choice’ doctrine. Nevertheless, as discussed, abortion is mainly sought for reasons that have nothing to do with the woman’s body, but instead her circumstances. Therefore, to afford legal personality to the subject of ectogenesis would reject this and subvert the temporal balance in law between the maternal/fetal rights and risk the fetal interests outweighing the mother’s. </p>

<p>Therefore, it is advisable that Parliament should address the definition of birth to make sure it cannot afford personhood to fetuses being placed into ectogenesis. A definition should classify AWT as merely an extension of the womb, unlike regular incubation, so birth cannot occur until a fetus is alive outside of the womb or any device acting as such. </p>

<h5 id="v-looking-forward-defining-awt-as-the-female-womb">V. Looking Forward: Defining AWT as the Female Womb</h5>

<p>Clearly, the many implications of AWT threaten viability, and destabilise the maternal/fetal balance. At first glance, the concept of viability will simply cease to be compatible with the context of abortion law once AWT is available. With viability from any stage of pregnancy, it is no longer a question, and so can no longer be a meaningful tool to balance the interest of the fetus against that of the mother. Consequently, without a meaningful standard of viability, the law must evidently shift to either retain the mother’s right to abortion (to avoid complete criminalisation of abortion) and eliminate the interests of the viable fetus, or vice versa. </p>

<p>However, this article suggests a re-conception of the viability threshold. The law generally aims to balance maternal/fetal interests through the viability standard.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a>In the U.S., where abortion is deemed a constitutional right, landmark decisions such as <em>Roe v Wade,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Planned Parenthood v Casey</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> and <em>Gonzales v Carhart</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> highlight the importance of viability as a tool to maintain the maternal/fetal balance. The viability thresholds in English law observed in the Abortion Act and IL(P)A are just further proof of the integration of the viability doctrine within abortion jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Therefore, retaining the doctrine of viability would be the most legally desirable outcome. Hence, Parliament should anticipatorily elect to not differentiate an artificial womb from a natural womb. This could be achieved by the insertion of a statutory provision into the Acts governing abortion, the AA 1967 and the IL(P)A 1929. Such a provision would classify AWT as the natural womb, or an extension thereof. Accordingly, there would be no differentiation in terms of the law of abortion between the wombs, and AWT could not be considered as a factor in viability. Following this approach, fetal viability would be judged against its <em>chance of survival</em> <em>if it were to be removed from ectogenesis</em>. </p>

<p>This would allow for the retention of viability, along with the statutory thresholds of the Abortion Act and IL(P)A. In essence, this approach would maintain the status quo and the manner in which abortion law is currently applied. Some may argue that this would be a missed opportunity to reform the law under a complete feminist stance, which would consolidate abortion as an absolute and unlimited right. Yet with only 0.1% of terminations taking place after the twenty-four week threshold in England and Wales in 2018,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> and 80% occurring before even 10 weeks,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> changing the law in a feminist direction and destabilising the sacred balance of interests would only make a trivial difference compared to upholding the viability doctrine via the proposed solution. In practice, the likelihood of late abortion based upon choice, and not necessity, is hypothetical, and such an approach would not have a detrimental effect on the pro-choice campaign.</p>

<h5 id="vi-conclusion">VI. Conclusion</h5>

<p>To conclude, AWT poses some dilemmas for the future, and will deem current legislative thresholds on viability obsolete. An analysis of the right to abortion has characterised it as evolving into a widely recognised right, and thus Parliament should act quickly on the ways to reconcile the relationship between AWT and abortion. Furthermore, if the laws are not amended, the viability doctrine will become ephemeral under AWT and will pose grave implications to women’s autonomy and access to abortion, including its criminalisation thereof.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whilst it is deemed legally desirable to balance the interests of the mother and the fetus, such a balance will be unable to be founded upon viability if AWT is deemed to be a factor thereof, and the concept will become superfluous. Therefore, to restore the balance, Parliament should consider approaches to AWT which retain the viability doctrine, which many argue is irreplaceable.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> This paper has suggested that the most simplistic approach to this is for a statutory provision to clarify that an artificial womb is to be treated no differently as the mother’s womb. Therefore, the AWT is not to be considered a factor of viability.</p>

	     <h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>

<p><em>The past November marked the 75th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg Trials, a milestone that the Tokyo Trial will in turn reach next May. These two proceedings instituted the long-awaited birth of international criminal justice, after the frustrated trial of Kaiser Wilhelm II following the Great War and the Treaty of Versailles. From the very outset, images played a fundamental role in shaping international criminal justice before its audience. This article analyses how the use of visual elements (i.e., the depiction of victim suffering) has been instrumental in driving international criminal justice – and, therefore, law – in certain directions, whereas censorship (i.e., the depiction of victimlessness) has contributed to the avoidance of undesired paths. I argue that this manipulation through image has been utilised to build a conscience of humankind and thus achieve greater legitimacy of international criminal law in its inaugural trials, while attempting to conceal one of the greatest pitfalls of the field: selectivity.</em></p>

<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>

<p>The trials of Nuremberg and Tokyo in 1945/1946 set in motion a system that, albeit with significant hiatuses, has been running for 75 years: international criminal justice. Even though these were two (obviously) distinct legal proceedings, Gerry Simpson has coined the term ‘Tokyoberg’ to refer to the twinned trials,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> which can be analysed as a single event where multiple revolutions occurred in the way we understand, and articulate, concepts such as individual responsibility, the criminalisation of war, and the invention of crimes against humanity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> I will make use of the Tokyobergian idea throughout the essay.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, international legal scholars conceptualised how international criminal justice, despite the contentions for its universality, had in fact been highly selective. McCormack asserted that selectivity is first found in relation to the acts the international community characterises as crimes and, secondly, in relation to the particular alleged atrocities that international criminal justice collectively prosecutes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> Simpson argued that a fundamental requirement of the rule of law is generality, and therefore the selective application of international criminal law entails a serious flaw in the international legal system itself and an impediment to the just application of these laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> Bothe identified that states are very cautious when creating law enforcement mechanisms that could potentially assert jurisdiction over their nationals, while conversely applying much wider views of liability in ‘safe’ frameworks (i.e., in situations where the exercise of jurisdiction over their own nationals is unlikely).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a></p>

<p>Fast forward to the 2010s – now with a permanent International Criminal Court operating for some years – a group of scholars studied a phenomenon which, as they found, had been instrumental in developing international criminal law: the utilisation of images. Schwöbel-Patel observed that international criminal tribunals, probably more than any other international institutions, have relied on videos and other forms of images to narrate their purpose and showcase the discipline of international criminal law and its main protagonists.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> Tallgren remarked that there is a relationship between images of suffering from ‘atrocity’ and the desired support for international criminal justice: seeking empathy and commitment to action by images is a frequent practice of humanitarianism and international criminal law gives special attention to victimhood.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> As she puts it, ‘images and international criminal justice make an enigmatic couple’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this essay is to combine the concepts of selectivity and imagery, by analysing the ways in which they intertwined in the emergence of international criminal justice. Today, 75 years after Tokyoberg, international criminal law still finds itself struggling to enhance its legitimacy by resorting to representational narratives<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> – a technique that goes back a long way. I do not intend to add to the criticism about the great, routine failures of the field, or, as it was recently construed, become another ‘pragmatist pointing out the obvious defects in the system’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Rather, this essay will trace back to the origins of international criminal justice to focus on how visual elements were utilised or discarded in Tokyoberg to exploit audiences and masquerade the well-known selectivity. The result, I argue, is the engineered dichotomic portrayal of, either, deeply tormented victims, or no victims at all.</p>

<h5 id="the-conscience-of-humankind-legalism-through-imagery">‘The Conscience of Humankind’: Legalism Through Imagery</h5>

<p>Nouwen and Werner illustrate that when an international criminal court is involved, the primary concern becomes ‘convincing the international community that justice is done’; that is, that the form of justice preferred by the international community is done.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Contrasted with the notion of ‘global justice’, other conceptions of law appear as particular, local and traditional.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Therefore, one of the objectives of international criminal law is to monopolise the prevailing discourses of such global justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> In <em>Tokyoberg</em>, this pursuit was evident.</p>

<p>Hartley Shawcross, Chief British prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, argued that ‘international law has in the past made some claim that there is a limit to the omnipotence of the state and that the individual … is not disentitled to the protection of mankind when the state tramples upon his rights in a manner which outrages the conscience of mankind.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> In a similar vein, Telford Taylor, the American lawyer who acted as Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg, addressed the judges by saying: ‘… we are not now indicting the German General Staff at the bar of history, but on specific charges of crimes against international law and the dictates of the conscience of mankind, as embodied in the Charter which governs this Court.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> The phrasing ‘conscience of mankind’ had originated at Versailles and re-emerged years later to underpin the effective kick-off of the international criminal justice system.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> This effort to construct a global justice to foster the protection of an overarching moral humanity earned, on the one hand, the praise of the philosopher Karl Jaspers – who saw the trials as a possibility to reorient Germany to the tradition of humanism as well as a renewal of the tradition of Western humanism itself for a cosmopolitan future – and, on the other, the mistrust of Hannah Arendt – who thought the social construction of moral or criminal guilt would exonerate not only Germans but humanity from the need for a more profound ethical and political response.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a></p>

<p>The narratives behind international criminal justice attempted to offset the weaknesses of the system (such as the concerns about victors’ justice and <em>ex post facto </em>criminal law) by appealing to the moral conscience of humanity, an allegedly global-shared value which was so superior, so intrinsic to the human being, that its damage could not be tolerated. This principle stemmed from the recognition of the supremacy of the law of humanity over the law of a sovereign state when it violates elementary human rights; particularly in a manner which may justly be held to shock the conscience of humankind.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Consequently, the merged notions of ‘conscience’ and ‘humankind’ offered a creative way out of the predicaments of inexistent positive criminal law, and thus became the legal basis buttressing legality in <em>Tokyoberg</em>. In parallel, victims became fundamental to reinforcing the theory of a damaged conscience and its need for redress. Invoking victimhood generally comes with a claim to authority, a claim that one is entitled to speak on behalf of the category of the actual victims, and on behalf of the abstract victim (i.e., humankind).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> This authority is also a claim to ‘authorship’, namely the power to write the story – and history – of victims in a particular way.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a></p>

<p>Against this background, imagery played a crucial role in the development of monopolistic legitimising discourses. Photographs and videos of victims have been used in international criminal justice to draw attention to selected acts that <em>must</em> shock the conscience of humankind, whereas other visuals have been deliberately concealed to sterilise the shocking capacity of the acts that they portrayed. The power culminates in shaping the focus: some suffering gets selected, passes through the elaborate international criminal justice procedural rites, is purified, and becomes confirmed as worthy of concern.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>Through this theoretical lens, the following sections examine the exhibition/concealment of imagery in the aftermath of the Second World War.</p>

<h5 id="ii-conscience-and-the-imagery-of-atrocity-intokyoberg">II. Conscience and the Imagery of Atrocity in <em>Tokyoberg</em></h5>

<p>The Allied powers were in need to forward the concept of global justice for the legitimacy of the trials. The task came not without dangers: the ghosts of <em>ex post facto</em> law and <em>ad hocery</em>, in addition to the sceptical – now contradictory – views that many Allies had had towards trying the Kaiser, threatened the success of the project. Versailles had been surrounded by a certain aversion to resorting to a law-rooted legitimacy for William II’s trial, to the extent that Article 227 included all kinds of euphemisms for ‘law’, but never the exact word. In this vein, Clemenceau wrote in 1920 that this “was not a case of a public accusation fundamentally of a legal character, but of an act of high international policy demanded by the conscience of mankind”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>In <em>Tokyoberg</em>, 25 years later, the legalistic approach attained much more preponderance. As Simpson contends, ‘Roosevelt was worrying about acquittals on technicalities and Robert Jackson – pressed on the existence of crimes against humanity or aggression – replied by saying “we can save ourselves from these pitfalls of definition if our test of what is a crime gives recognition to those things which fundamentally outrage the conscience of the American people.” The victims of war crimes had become the people in general … This became at trial the idea of “shocking the conscience of mankind.”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The trial was understood as an exercise in the reconstitution of the law, an act staged not only to punish extreme crimes but to demonstrate the power of the law to submit the most horrific outrages to the hand of justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> In this regard, the trial was to serve as a spectacle of legality, making visible both the crimes of the Germans and the neutral authority of the rule of law: the idiom of judgment on this point took the form of ‘crimes against humanity’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a></p>

<p>The situation presented other hurdles for the United States as well. International criminal law was supposed to redress the egregious acts carried out by the Nazi and Japanese regimes, and the core legitimacy to try the perpetrators was contained in the shocking capacity of those deeds of moral turpitude. But how could the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, crimes equally capable of shocking consciences, be left out? The Americans were not the only ones facing these quandaries, as the British carried the burden of the carpet bombings of several German cities (causing more than 300,000 civilian deaths)<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> and the Soviets faced responsibility for the terrible Katyn Massacre, among others.</p>

<p>In this delicate scenario, the portrayal of images to audiences was meticulously designed. Which events to expose graphically, and which to hide, became a matter that the victor states carefully calculated in parallel to the <em>Tokyobergian </em>implementation. This exploitation was instrumental in perfecting the legalism that was needed as a pillar of the trials. Michalczyk presents a thorough review of the usage of visual elements before and during Nuremberg, where accounts in the form of both photographs and movies were broadcasted to a big portion of the world’s population, especially to those affected by the war.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a></p>

<p>In February 1945, some months after the first camps were liberated by the Soviets, a director working for the British Ministry of Information Film Division contacted the Allied Psychological Warfare Division in order to collect and produce material ‘with a view to preparing a film which will show the German atrocities in many parts of the world’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> By June, camps had also been discovered by the Allies advancing from the West. The Anglo-German newsreel ‘Welt im Film’ (‘The World on Film’) was released, explicitly depicting the atrocities in a series of graphic scenes from concentration camps. Its showcase became part of the denazification plan, encompassing the message ‘Dass ist Faschismus, dass ist Nationalsozialismus’ (‘That is Fascism, that is National Socialism’).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Screenings were made compulsory in Allied-occupied Germany.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a></p>

<p>In September 1945, Robert Jackson, Chief US Prosecutor at Nuremberg, personally reviewed a film called ‘That Justice Be Done’ (produced by the Office of Strategic Services and also translated to German) and believed that the short documentary would be a means of educating the public about the rationale for an international trial. Released in theatres in October, the film allowed Americans to view on screen the oppressive Nazi rule in the context of the ideals of the American system of justice.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> The US Signal Corps were instructed to document extensively – and vividly – the results of the Nazi monstruous atrocities, producing photos and films that were designed to ‘document history as well as inform an incredulous world that lay unaware of the concentration camp nightmare.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, the Soviets also did their part. During the trial they presented significant amounts of film evidence showing the civilians that had been massacred in various Nazi camps. The piles of corpses and emaciated prisoners were displayed explicitly. In the minds of the Soviets, the presentation of this footage of atrocities at Nuremberg would further assure that their victimhood at the hands of the Nazis would be viewed in an international forum. This compilation of four reels of material, lasting approximately one hour, screened for the Tribunal, included the newsreels and documentaries which had already been shown in Russian theatres.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> The footage established an important narrative in which Soviet images of Nazi atrocities predominated, in addition to depictions of the triumphant marches of the Red Army.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> Hicks reflects that ‘propaganda was inextricably entwined with atrocity; indeed, the latter would not have been shown without the former.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a></p>

<p>The Nuremberg trial spectacle included not only films and photographs of victims, but actual victims’ remains. ‘The shrunken head of Buchenwald’ – a fist-sized human head with the skull bone removed, stuffed, and preserved – was exhibited in the courtroom as vivid proof of the barbarous Nazi experiments. The scholar Lawrence Douglas has analysed the prosecution’s rhetoric around the shrunken head, in connection to the legalistic discourse that acted as bedrock to the ‘crimes against humanity’ limb of the accusation. The cranium, Douglas concludes, served as the most tangible representation of Nazi crimes as atavistic: an unquestionable testimony that the acts performed at the camps belonged to an era that predated civilisation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> Therefore, law was meant to act as the protector of a civilised humankind. In Robert Jackson’s words: ‘If we cannot eliminate the causes and prevent the repetition of these barbaric events, it is not an irresponsible prophecy to say that this twentieth century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Photos of the shrunken head became some of the best-known images associated with the trial.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a></p>

<p>The fact that great part of the visual testimonies was not only used at the trials, but also broadcasted to the general population, speaks significantly about the intention that underlay the juridical necessity of presenting evidence that could not only contribute to the criminal conviction of the accused, but also outrage the civilised conscience. Schwöbel-Patel’s theory on spectacle in international criminal law is an applicable framework to reflect the logic behind <em>Tokyoberg</em>: ‘Understanding victims of international crime as spectacularized directs attention to the visual and rhetorical signification of the social construction of victimhood … and more broadly to the understanding of international criminality and its apparent antithesis of humanitarianism.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> The creation of images – and their timely distribution – became part of the legitimising machinery claiming for justice to be done in <em>Tokyoberg</em>.</p>

<h5 id="iii-the-mushroom-cloud-censorship-in-occupied-japan">III. ‘The Mushroom Cloud’: Censorship in Occupied Japan</h5>

<p>On the other hand, <em>Tokyoberg</em> worked to erase (or, worse, instrumentalise) the atomic bombings Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Until the United States ceased the Japanese occupation in 1952, no photographs or videos portraying the damage caused to civilians were released.</p>

<p>One of the earliest accounts on selectivity applied in international criminal justice belongs to Justice Pal in his famous dissent at Tokyo. He was outraged by the concept of trying leaders for crimes of which the prosecutors were themselves guilty: the decision of the American government to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was, in his assessment, a clear example of a crime against humanity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> Cryer praises Pal’s exposition for identifying this primeval bias in international criminal justice,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> which contrasted with the widespread notion that <em>Tokyoberg</em> should be regarded as the beginning of a new era of accountability, a milestone in the fight against the impunity of those who shock the conscience of humankind.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> In addition, Justice Pal stated: ‘his decision to use the atom bomb is the only near approach to the directives of the German emperor during the first world war and of the Nazi leaders during the second world war. Nothing like this could be traced to the credit of the accused.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> Pal’s dissenting opinion was not read at the trial and it was not published in Japan after the American occupation was finished.</p>

<p>The use of atomic weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not awaken what some hoped would ‘bring about a unity of humanity, linked to all our fellow human beings, irrespective of race, creed, or color, by bonds which have been fused unbreakably in the diabolical heat of these explosions’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> In the end, Justice Pal concluded, there was no justification for these inhuman blasts.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> In the same vein, one of the Japanese members of the defence counsel, Okamoto Shoichi,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> strived to bring justice to the victims of the bombings: he was convinced that indiscriminate attacks on civilians with atomic bombs clearly constituted war crimes that should not have gone unnoticed in the Tokyo Trial.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a></p>

<p>However, the lack of consideration of the atrociousness of the atomic bombings at the trial received surprisingly meagre commentaries outside of Pal’s and Shoichi’s. As Polunina highlights, even the Soviets – who had complained about many failures of the proceedings – remained remarkably reserved about Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the trial and in their home press.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a></p>

<p>The United States carefully engineered a strict censorship mechanism which was in force during most times of the American occupation, and even when there were brief periods of press freedom, reporting on atomic damage was basically done through eyewitness accounts and scarce scientific evidence.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> A special unit was created: the ‘Publications, Pictorial and Broadcast Section’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> It issued a ‘Manual on Censorship in Japan’ directed to the censors, in which they were told that their primary mission was to ensure that the efforts of Japan to emerge from its defeat as a new nation, entitled to a place among the peace-loving nations of the world, would not be harmed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> In January 1946, the motion picture industry in Japan was informed that no film could be shown without prior clearance by the censors, including simple paper movies shown by itinerant storytellers.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> Even those who owned films had to make detailed reports of them.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Alongside the endeavours to conceal the horrifying effects of the bombings, the manipulation of photographs and videos was intended to portray an image of Japan’s war guilt, both inside Japan and to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Even prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, imagery had been utilised for the stigmatisation of the Japanese regime within the Western collective imagination. When the Japanese army attacked Shanghai in the summer of 1937, the photographer H. S. Wong, working for an American agency, captured the image of a Chinese baby covered in blood, crying desperately, surrounded by destroyed railway tracks. Wong would later recall that the baby’s mother lay dead some meters away from him.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> The picture, titled ‘Bloody Saturday’, was sent to New York and featured in Hearst newsreels, newspapers and life magazine—the widest audience a picture could then have.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> Viewed by more than 136 million people, it struck a personal chord that transcended ethnicity and geography: to many, the infant’s pain represented Japan’s bloodlust.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> The photograph is now included in TIME’s magazine ‘Most Influential Images of All Time’.</p>

<p>TIME’s collection contains, as well, a depiction of the drop of the atomic bomb. When the 20-kiloton weapon hit Nagasaki, approximately 80 thousand people died instantly. However, the iconic photograph shows no humans, but a massive cloud of radioactive debris, as it was taken by Lieutenant Charles Levy from the US observation aircraft named, paradoxically, ‘The Great Artiste’. According to TIME, ‘Officials censored photos of the bomb’s devastation, but Levy’s image … was circulated widely. The effect shaped American opinion in favor of the nuclear bomb, leading the nation to celebrate the atomic age.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> The sanitised depersonalisation of the bombings was rigorously devised and presented as nothing but military progress against the bellicose enemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the quote by Benjamin Wright, a historian at UT Texas who recently contributed to curate a book containing Japanese photographs of the bombed cities and populations, can illustrate a sentiment that still lingers: ‘Americans, when they think about atomic war, think about the mushroom cloud.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a></p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Kendall and Nouwen argue that international criminal justice operates in the representation of victims in two ways: through their participation in trials, and through the discursive invocation of abstract victimhood.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> The latter, which transcends all actual victims and corresponds to no individual victims in their particularity, becomes a figure of victimhood that is deployed as a kind of new sovereign of international criminal law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> The aesthetics of this victimhood, coming back to the notion of spectacle in international criminal law, are presented to the audience in the most colourful and dramatic way possible.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a></p>

<p>The narratives around <em>Tokyoberg </em>were constructed to invoke the sentiments of the international community towards the pressing need to punish those who had outraged the conscience of humankind. In that effort, a massive display of imagery was presented to the different audiences around the world, which were juridically and sensorially summoned to integrate the morality of international law and claim for justice. For this purpose, the vivid construction of victimhood was paramount.</p>

<p>However, <em>Tokyoberg</em> also represents the dialectic dyad of victimhood versus <em>victimlessness</em>. These two contrasting concepts encompassed the building of a conscience of humankind that was carefully produced and discursively engineered to consolidate a juridical humanity 75 years ago. In the prevailing discourse, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atrocities were sterilised: they became the mushroom clouds, the deserved response to a war-guilty nation, the effort to bring war to an end. Unseen were the images of humans suffering, and intact remained the assembled conscience of humankind. The <em>hibakusha</em> victimhood belongs to the ‘missing scenes’ of the <em>Tokyoberg</em> movie. In its place: the dehumanised victimlessness.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline62" href="#62">62</a></p>

	     <h4 id="abstract">Abstract:</h4>

<p>This article analyses the European Court of Human Rights’ use of the concepts of ‘European consensus’ and ‘margin of appreciation’ in light of their effects on minority rights. Normative justifications and objections to the Court’s use of the doctrines are outlined. Through an exploration of the Court’s jurisprudence on minority rights within the European Convention on Human Rights framework, the article illustrates that the Court’s opaque approach to its use of the doctrines can lead to a dilution of the protection of minority rights. The article concludes that it will thus be crucial for the Court to provide safeguards for any future use of these interpretive tools in cases where minority rights are at stake.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>This article embarks on a critical discussion of the European Court of Human Rights’ (“ECtHR”) use of European consensus (“EuC”) and the margin of appreciation (“MoA”) in light of its effect on minority rights. The two concepts are firstly defined and situated in context. Thereafter, normative justifications and objections to the use of EuC in determining the width of the MoA are outlined. The article does not provide a thorough review of the Court’s general case law on minority rights. Rather, it highlights a lack of clarity in the Court’s application of EuC and MoA and the consequences flowing from this. This is illustrated through a line of cases regarding the rights of transgender persons, Roma children and Muslim women. The article concludes that while there is some value in the ECtHR’s current approach, it will nonetheless be important for the Court to develop a consistent and rigorous methodology for the application of the doctrines in cases regarding minority rights. This is crucial for the Court to maintain its role as guardian of the European human rights regime.</p>

<h4 id="the-contours-of-the-interpretive-tools">The Contours of the Interpretive Tools</h4>

<p>The MoA refers to “the room for manoeuvre Strasbourg institutions are prepared to accord national authorities in fulfilling their obligations” under the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a>  The EuC refers to “the level of uniformity present in the legal frameworks of the member States of the Council of Europe on a particular topic”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a>  The Court uses EuC to justify a wide MoA afforded to Member States in the absence of consensus, and advance new standards where there is a clear trend present across Member States.</p>

<p>The tools are mostly used at the third stage of review of qualified rights – following the first two stages, which require any interference with qualified rights to be prescribed by law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. A key question at the third stage is the degree of deference the Court ought to afford states in determining whether a particular interference with a right is necessary in a democratic society to protect the legitimate aims listed in the ECHR. In general, where there is a lack of an EuC, the Court will afford a broader MoA to Member States, and vice versa. Further, the scope of the MoA afforded directly relates to the strictness of review: the wider the margin, the less strict the scrutiny by the Court, and vice versa.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a>  Thus, the existence of an EuC is the determining factor for the Court when defining the scope of the MoA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a></p>

<h4 id="the-normative-foundation">The Normative Foundation</h4>

<p>The question to be addressed at the outset is whether the Court’s use of an EuC to determine the width of the MoA can be normatively justified. A central role of the ECtHR is to correct injustices perpetrated by the majority against minorities.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a>  Indeed, the Court has declared that part of its mandate is to protect individuals from infringements of Convention rights “grounded upon a predisposed bias on the part of a […] majority against a […] minority”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a>  This invites the question of which interpretive tools are appropriate to employ in fulfilling this mandate. In evaluating whether EuC is an appropriate tool, two competing elements are emphasised: firstly, the importance of the expansion of the protection traditionally afforded under a Convention right by the Court to vulnerable minority groups, and secondly, the recognition that the impact of such a progressive interpretation is grounded in the Court’s legitimacy vis-à-vis Member States.</p>

<p>Objections to EuC stem from the Court’s mandate of safeguarding minority rights. Minorities are often barred from equal participation in the democratic process domestically – it is therefore important for the ECtHR to serve as a “countermajoritarian check”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> Critics have highlighted the inherent contradiction in the ECtHR resorting to a quantitative exercise in determining the EuC, particularly where the applicant belongs to a minority group.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> In light of the Court’s mandate, reliance on EuC seems “counterintuitive, if not problematic, when determining the rights of unpopular social groups and minorities”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>The Court must exercise caution in applying the doctrines in the context of minority rights. Lodging a complaint to the ECtHR can be the only recourse to justice a minority has when the rights of its members are not protected domestically. Indeed, affording states a wide MoA on the basis of a lack of a uniform approach might deprive a minority of human rights protection, since the institution established to promote their rights will be relying on the same majoritarian bias that the group is seeking to reverse. For groups that have experienced widespread, systemic abuses of their rights, the EuC seems to be a counterproductive tool to determine their rights.</p>

<p>In defence of the doctrine, it is argued that the use of EuC is justified, as it aids the Court in preserving its legitimacy. The Court operates under the principle of subsidiarity, which “determines its role as secondary to […] national legal orders […] that have the primary responsibility of implementing and interpreting the Convention”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> A state in disagreement of a judgment can, in principle, choose not to renew the right of individual petition, withdraw from the Convention, or express its discontent through failing to or delaying its compliance with a judgment. The Court is faced with a difficult task: it must reverse rights-abusive practices of Contracting States whilst preserving its legitimacy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> With the surge of criticism that the Court “has frequently exceeded its mandate”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> consensus-based interpretation can provide a means to legitimise the Court’s judgments and ensure their enforcement.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> For the Court to guard the European human rights regime, its legitimacy must be preserved. Otherwise, the Court’s decisions will have a limited practical effect within domestic legal systems and the substantive protection of human rights will effectively be removed.</p>

<p>Finally, the use of EuC in determining the scope of the MoA has been justified on the basis that the Court can rely on the doctrines to interpret the Convention progressively and strengthen minority rights. As contended by Tzevelekos and Dzehtsiarou, when minority rights are at stake in a given case, the Court has a compelling justification to use the tools with greater flexibility and enhance the protection of minority rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> Such an approach can render the tools normatively compatible with the two competing accounts on the role of EuC in minority rights cases. However, as it is more likely that a consensus exists against a minority when examining minority rights under the lens of EuC, the danger exists that the Court’s application of the tools can stifle minority rights. It is therefore pertinent that the Court adopts this approach – namely, relying on the doctrines to strengthen minority rights – uniformly across cases concerning minority groups.</p>

<h4 id="the-courts-approach-opaque-or-clear">The Court’s Approach: Opaque or Clear?</h4>

<p>To illustrate the Court’s approach to EuC and MoA, the article focuses on application of the doctrines in cases concerning three minority groups where the Court has adopted substantively different approaches: the rights of transgender persons, Roma children, and Muslim women.</p>

<p>The Court’s opaque approach can be illustrated in a line of cases concerning the rights of transgender persons. The line begins with <em>Rees,</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> regarding the legal recognition of the sexual identity of post-operative transsexual individuals. The Court found that an EuC was not present, as there was “little common ground between the Contracting States in this area and that […] the law appear[ed] to be in a transitional state”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> Consequently, the Court afforded the state a wide MoA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> The Court recognised the severity of the consequences caused by a lack of legal recognition of this group of persons’ identity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a>Despite this, the Court held that the lack of an EuC outweighed the interest in applying strict review of the State’s infringement of their rights under Article 8. The Court, however, warned states to keep this area of the law “under review”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> and adapt their legislation accordingly.</p>

<p>In the cases of <em>Cossey</em> <a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> and <em>Sheffield</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> the Court reaffirmed its position in <em>Rees.</em> The majority found that developments in the legislation of Member States was not enough for the Court to determine that an EuC was now present.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> While this was in line with its reasoning in <em>Rees</em>, the Court failed to signal what specifically within the field the states ought to keep under review to update legislation in line with the Convention. The dissenting opinion of Judge Martiens reveals a disagreement between the judges on this point. Judge Martiens found that the existence of an EuC on the matter was strongly reinforced by the increased consensus from five to fourteen Contracting States, along with supporting resolutions by “the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament recommending that reclassification of the sex of a post-operative transsexual be made legally possible”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> The disagreement between judges highlights the lack of a clear set of criteria for the determination of EuC. This lack of clarity resulted in the Court widening the MoA and refraining from applying strict review to strengthen this category of persons’ rights.</p>

<p>The turning point in the case law was <em>Goodwin</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> where the Court officially narrowed the MoA for Member States on the legal recognition of the sexual identity of post-operative transsexual individuals. The determining factor was, once again, EuC. The Court found that there was still a lack of “a common European approach”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> Despite this being the main factor preventing the Court from taking a step forward in the protection of transgender rights in the aforementioned cases, the Court turned its approach on its head. The Court attached “less importance to the lack of” an EuC “than to the clear and uncontested evidence of a continuing international trend in favour not only of increased social acceptance of transsexuals but of legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> It is clear that the Court has neither developed, nor is bound by, any strict criteria in applying the doctrines.</p>

<p>The breakthrough of the <em>Goodwin</em> judgement does not mark the end of the saga. As confirmed in <em>Goodwin</em>: while the Court found that EuC existed regarding the legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals, the Court did not find that EuC was present regarding states’ determination of the conditions to such recognition.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> Requirements set out by states for legal recognition varied and most of these criteria were criticised, including for undermining individual autonomy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> In <em>A.P., Garçon</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> the Court examined the compatibility of the ECHR requirements for gender recognition of an “irreversible change in appearance”, interpreted as compulsory sterilisation,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> and the mandatory diagnosis of “gender identity disorder”. The Court found that a common approach was not present on the subject, as states were divided regarding the sterility requirement.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> Nevertheless, the Court relied on a trend emerging in recent years towards abolishing the condition.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> Despite the lack of a strong EuC on the subject, the Court found the trend to be a sufficient basis on which to narrow the MoA. The Court therefore employed strict review of the applicant’s rights and ruled that the compulsory sterilisation requirement violated the applicants’ Article 8 rights.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a></p>

<p>As mandatory sex reassignment surgery interferes with physical integrity to a similar extent as forced sterilisation, a logical next step in this evolution would have been to find such a requirement to violate Article 8 in the case of <em>X v FYROM</em>.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> The requirement of mandatory sex reassignment bars transgender, genderfluid, non-binary and other  genderqueer persons who choose not to or are unable to undergo sex reassignment surgery from gender recognition. In their dissenting opinion, judges Pejchal and Wojtyczek criticised the judgement of <em>Garçon</em> for finding that a ‘trend’ was sufficient to narrow the MoA. They argued that such an analysis was a typical sign of “judicial activism”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> Because of the disagreements within the Court on the proper application of EuC, the Court “refused to examine the applicant’s claim that mandatory sex reassignment surgery as a requirement for gender recognition […] violated Article 8”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a></p>

<p>The Court in <em>Goodwin</em> identified three hallmarks of proper decision-making, all vital to uphold the rule of law: “legal certainty, foreseeability and equality”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> Ironically, the Court’s approach to the application of the doctrines violates all three. Throughout the ECtHR’s jurisprudence on transgender rights, the Court has failed to sufficiently determine the scope and proper application of EuC despite the vital role this tool has played. Lack of legal certainty and foreseeability flows from this. Disagreements about EuC resulted in “the Court’s reluctance to directly address pathologizing conditions for legal gender recognition”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> thus aggravating existing vulnerabilities of this minority group.</p>

<h4 id="the-courts-opaque-approach-strengthening-or-diluting-minority-rights">The Court’s Opaque Approach: Strengthening or Diluting Minority Rights?</h4>

<p>Does the Court’s opaque approach to EuC undermine or reinforce the Court’s ability to enforce the protection of minority rights? Philosophers from Aristotle to Hart have recognized that all systems of law must negotiate a fundamental tension between legal certainty and flexibility.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> The Court’s lack of a clear methodology in its application of EuC has enabled the Court to employ the doctrine with full flexibility.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> Dzehtsiarou argues that the Court is aware of the limitations to their use of the doctrine, and that where minority rights are at stake, the Court has convincing justification to use the tool with greater flexibility or lessen the weight placed on it.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> Flexibility can allow the Court to take progressive steps for minority rights, even in situations where an EuC is not conclusively present.</p>

<p>The flexibility of the doctrines has indeed enabled the Court to rely on EuC to determine the applicants’ minority status to narrow the MoA of states and consequently enhance their protection under the Convention. This can be illustrated through the case of <em>Oršuš.</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> The application concerned Roma children’s right to education.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> Roma children were placed in separate classes in Croatia on account of their lack of proficiency in Croatian language. The Courtnoted an emerging consensus amongst Member States recognising the “special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> The Court relied on EuC to determine the status of the applicants as members of a minority group. This enabled the Court to narrow the MoA and exercise intense scrutiny of the measure. The flexibility of the tool allowed “the Court space for manoeuvre”<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> in its application of EuC, and to strengthen the rights of a vulnerable minority group.</p>

<p>However, the lack of a clear approach in the application of EuC in cases regarding minority rights has stripped the Court of the necessary constraints in its application of the doctrines in this realm. As illustrated by the case of <em>SAS</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> EuC has been used to the detriment of minority rights without sufficient justification. The case concerned a French blanket ban prohibiting the covering of one’s face in public. The Court recognised that the measure interfered with the rights of a minority group, namely “Muslim women who choose to manifest their religion through wearing religious attire”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a> The Court noted that, “from a strictly normative standpoint”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> France was in a minority position in Europe as few Member States had imposed such a blanket ban. However, the Court found that because such a blanket ban had been the subject of debate in some Member States, which was proof of a lack of an EuC against the ban,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a> and France was afforded a wide MoA.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> As noted by the dissenting opinion, “it is difficult to understand why the majority [were] not prepared to accept the existence” of an EuC against the ban,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> when “an overwhelming majority, [had] not deemed it necessary to legislate in this area”, and thus “a very strong indicator for a European consensus” against the ban existed.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a>In contrast to its reasoning in the <em>Oršuš</em> case, the Court did not rely on the EuC to invite closer scrutiny in light of the applicant’s minority status. Rather, the determination of EuC formed part of the foundation on which the Court held that the ban was proportionate to the aim pursued, rendering it necessary in a democratic society, and thus that the interference with this minority group’s rights was justified.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> It is clear that the danger exists that the flexibility of the tool can weaken the Court’s ability to protect minority groups from discriminatory, majoritarian measures of Member States.</p>

<h4 id="safeguards-for-the-future-of-the-european-human-rights-regime">Safeguards for the Future of the European Human Rights Regime</h4>

<p>The Brighton Declaration,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> today reflected in the 2018 Copenhagen Declaration <a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> and Protocol 15, which enshrines subsidiarity and the MoA in the preamble of the ECHR, signals that the “centre of gravity of the Convention system” will “be lower than it is today, closer temporally and spatially to all Europeans”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> It is clear that EuC and the MoA will play a vital role for the future of the ECtHR in shifting the focus to a “shared responsibility”.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> It is therefore important to provide safeguards to the future use of these tools.</p>

<p>Against a backdrop of the rising threats of climate change, nuclear weapons and the COVID-19 pandemic, one does not have to imagine a consensus or trend developing in Europe where personal liberties are restricted in the interests of national security or public safety and health. It is therefore crucial that the advancement of minority rights in the Court’s jurisprudence is not “inextricably linked to majoritarian consent expressed through EuC” and that infringements of rights are rigorously scrutinised by the Court.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a> The failure to articulate with precision the scope and function of EuC poses a potentially grave threat to the ECtHR’s role as the arbiter of European human rights, particularly of minorities.</p>

<p>The time has come to develop a consistent and rigorous methodology for the application of EuC in cases regarding minority rights. If the Court accepts the need to narrow the MoA where minority rights are involved, a clearer test must be developed of the appropriate relationship between EuC and minority protection. This will ensure a consistent approach across cases regarding the rights of minority groups. Alternatively, where the Court departs from this approach, it must provide convincing analysis in its reasoning for the necessity of this. The Court must strive to develop clear, general principles for weighing the competing elements of the EuC and the MoA doctrines in cases where minority rights are at stake. Such safeguards must be in place to ensure that EuC is applied with careful consideration of minority rights across the Court’s jurisprudence.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The string of cases regarding transgender rights is glaring proof of the Court’s opaque approach in applying the doctrines of EuC and MoA, underlined by the ongoing disagreement within the Court and the lack of constraint which the Court’s application of EuC in earlier cases proved to have on its approach in subsequent cases. This approach has enabled the Court to take progressive steps in the fight for minority rights, as illustrated by the cases of <em>Goodwin, Garçon</em> and <em>Oršuš.</em> However, the Court’s approach has also resulted in a dilution of minority rights, as illustrated in the cases of <em>SAS</em> and <em>X v FYROM</em>. The article recognises that the Court’s approach has enabled it to mitigate disagreements within the Court and navigate the tension between operating under the principle of subsidiarity and the role it has reserved for itself in securing the rights of marginalised groups. However, it is concluded that the Court must develop a clearer methodology to underpin its use of the doctrines in order to ensure that minority rights are strengthened rather than diluted. The appropriate application of the doctrines in cases regarding minority rights must be clearly defined and consistently adopted across the Court’s jurisprudence. Transparency, legal certainty and equity – key facets of the Court’s process legitimacy – are safeguards that must be kept in place. Only then can judges of the ECtHR “hold firm the compass of morality, guiding the communal ship towards more enlightened standards, [whilst] taking into account the prevailing winds and sea conditions”,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a> and reinforce its crucial role in securing minority rights protection across Europe.</p>

	     <h4 id="abstract">Abstract:</h4>

<p><em>Investor-State Dispute Settlement is currently facing a legitimacy crisis which threatens to rattle the very foundations of the system. It is suggested this crisis can be divided in two: a procedural crisis, which can be addressed by reform, and a substantive crisis, which threatens the existence of the entire regime. This article focuses on the deeper substantive crisis caused by the problem of reverse discrimination. Specifically, it engages with constitutional terms of analysis to address the way in which reverse discrimination undermines national constitutional stability. It analyses exactly why the affront to constitutional stability is currently becoming particularly hard to bear for nation states. The conclusion is that the substantive legitimacy crisis faced by investment treaty law can only be addressed by a comprehensive repeal of the system.</em></p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>The EU has failed to reach an agreement with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in large part because of its Investment Chapter: neither party could accept that foreign investors would be subject to a different set of rights than domestic companies.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a> It is patently clear that the legitimacy of Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) is currently under threat.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a> The first point is that the ISDS system currently faces two separate, but related, legitimacy crises. The first crisis, of procedural legitimacy, is strictly internal to the system – it stems from issues related to the way in which ISDS is dispensed. Importantly, these issues can be addressed by reform without significantly overhauling the system. The second, substantive legitimacy crisis, is exogenous to the workings of the system – it is rooted in the very logic of investment treaty law. The focus of this article is on this second, existential, challenge to the system. An insight will be provided into the issue of ‘reverse discrimination’, a practice through which foreign investors are able to use bilateral investment treaties (BITs) to obtain a different treatment than national companies. The existing literature on this topic describes the problems created by reverse discrimination in rather broad terms: reverse discrimination is accused of generally ‘undermining democratic accountability’ and ‘threatening legitimacy’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a> The central purpose of the present article is to couch the issue of reverse discrimination in much more specific constitutional terms. As such, we will argue why the very logic of investment treaty law compromises constitutional commitments on the national level. We will also analyse why exactly this birth defect is now emerging as particularly unpalatable for sovereign states. This will lead to the unassailable conclusion that abandoning the ISDS system is necessary in order to protect national constitutional stability. </p>

<h4 id="1--explaining-the-two-aspects-of-the-legitimacy-crisis">1.  Explaining the two aspects of the legitimacy crisis</h4>

<p>It is widely understood that the ISDS system is currently plunged in a profound legitimacy crisis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has formerly recognized this in asserting the pressing need for reform.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> Its most recent Working Paper (2020) identified three proposals: (i) the potential introduction of a ‘stand-alone review or appellate mechanism’; (ii)  the creation of a ‘multilateral investment court’; and (iii) a fairer ‘selection and appointment of arbitrators and adjudicators’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> These proposals recognise that ISDS is undergoing a procedural legitimacy crisis, one which is strictly internal to the system. Their aim is therefore to reform ISDS from the inside. Importantly, the UNCITRAL diagnoses a strictly procedural crisis: they do not call for integral repeal of the system, but rather, seek to reform a number of its procedures. </p>

<p>Kelsey et al. note that a narrow focus on procedural issues carries the risk of ignoring the substantive challenges to the system – i.e. those which pose an existential threat to ISDS.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a> To a certain extent, it is not a surprise that UNCITRAL refuses to address substantive critiques of the system. Indeed, it is uniquely set up to look at the system from an internal perspective. The Guide to UNCITRAL published by the UNCITRAL secretariat states that part of the Commission’s mandate is to promote ’wider participation in existing international conventions and wider acceptance of existing model and uniform laws’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> As a reform body, it is engineered to consider only issues of procedure, without ever challenging the logic of ISDS itself. </p>

<p>Our contention is that a wider substantive legitimacy crisis dwarfs the narrow procedural crisis addressed by UNCITRAL. Specifically, the issue of reverse discrimination threatens to shake the constitutional foundations of sovereign states. The remainder of this article focuses on this broader, existential challenge, and explores why the system must therefore be overturned.</p>

<h4 id="2--the-substantive-aspect-of-the-legitimacy-crisis-how-reverse-discrimination-threatens-constitutional-stability">2.  The substantive aspect of the legitimacy crisis: how reverse discrimination threatens constitutional stability</h4>

<h5 id="a-how-does-isds-entail-reverse-discrimination"><strong>a) How does ISDS entail reverse discrimination?</strong></h5>

<p>Originally, the vast majority of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) were signed between a developed, capital-exporting country and a developing, capital-importing country.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a> As Jandhyala et. al note, during the first wave of BIT signings, ’the adoption of a BIT helped reassure foreign investors by offsetting weak and unstable domestic institutions in host countries.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Foreign investors would be encouraged to invest in developing countries, emboldened by the certainty that their investment would not be subjected to host country legal institutions, and therefore not expropriated or confiscated.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> BITs were thus a way to hedge against political risk through law. Legally, these treaties were always reciprocal, but investment flows almost never came towards the developed country, which meant that policies in developed countries were very rarely challenged in investment arbitrations. As Mann demonstrates, the bilateral dimension of BITs was initially included only as a ceremonial recognition of the developing country’s sovereignty – in this sense, reciprocity was ’a matter of prestige [rather] than reality’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> This changed when Free Trade Agreements including investment chapters (such as NAFTA and the Energy Charter Treaty<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> were concluded between countries with equally strong commitments to democracy and the rule of law. Suddenly, it became evident that foreign investors could challenge national policies in democratic states. Specifically, this entails that a foreign investor is not subject to the same regime as a national investor: where a national investor has no choice but to abide by national regulations, a foreign investor is able to challenge certain measures as per the terms of the BIT. This epitomises the problem of ‘reverse discrimination’ which exists in favour of foreign investors. </p>

<h5 id="b-reverse-discrimination--the-threat-to-constitutional-stability"><strong>b) Reverse discrimination – the threat to constitutional stability</strong></h5>

<p>Much of the existing literature describes the problems raised by reverse discrimination in rather broad terms: reverse discrimination is accused of generally ‘undermining democratic accountability,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a> ’unduly limiting the policy space of signatory governments<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> and ‘threatening legitimacy’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> The purpose of the present article is to frame the issue of reverse discrimination in much more specific constitutional terms. In doing so, we will reach a clearer understanding of why ISDS, and more specifically reverse discrimination, poses an affront to constitutional stability. </p>

<h5 id="i-the-framework-of-analysis"><em><u>(i) The framework of analysis</u></em></h5>

<p>As Halberstam sets out, a nation state is a social artefact – its inherent purpose is to further the needs and aspirations of its constituents.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a> From this premise, Dawson and De Witte have concluded that a polity is ’only stable and legitimate, then, if it structurally incorporates and reflects the values that ”matter” to its constituents’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> Accordingly, durable legitimacy requires a dual commitment to ‘self-determination’. The first commitment is to ‘political self-determination’: it requires having an institutional mechanism which mediates between competing visions within the polity.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> This process, which invites all contrasting views to come together in deciding on policy outcomes, enables these very outcomes to be shrouded in a certain legitimacy. The second commitment is to ensure that, from a legal perspective, legal actors are free and equal.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a></p>

<p>We propose to assess ISDS in light of this theoretical framework set out by Dawson and De Witte. We hope to demonstrate the extent to which the very logic of the system, which brings about reverse discrimination, undermines the two central tenets of stability and legitimacy in a nation state. Therein, we contend, lies the real reason for the ISDS system’s legitimacy crisis. </p>

<h5 id="ii-how-does-reverse-discrimination-undermine-states-political-ownership-over-laws-and-regulations"><em><u>(ii) How does reverse discrimination undermine states' political ownership over laws and regulations?</u></em></h5>

<p>Through the problem of reverse discrimination, ISDS both challenges and undermines states’ ability to decide upon their own rules and regulations. This is epitomised, firstly, by the fact that certain ISDS proceedings result in states having to pay out of public funds for democratically reached policy choices. Kelsey et al. note that this is perceived as particularly problematic when pay-outs are destined to large transnational corporations and redirected away from spending on education and healthcare.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a> In many situations, this problem is amplified by the lack of transparency that covers many investment arbitrations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a></p>

<p>A number of states have voiced their concerns on this very matter. The South African Government, in their proposal to the UNCITRAL, highlighted that the ISDS system creates a framework where ’the investors’ property and contractual rights supersede public interest and public needs’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a> Specifically, they raised the point that the system is ’detrimental to public budgets, regulations in the public interest, democracy and the rule of law’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Similar concerns have also been echoed by Brazil and Indonesia before the UNCITRAL.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a></p>

<p>The paradigm example of this problem was demonstrated by the <em>Vattenfall</em> ICSID decision, where a Swedish company, having invested in nuclear energy in Germany, was successful in obtaining compensation for Germany’s political decision to exit from nuclear energy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a> Against the backdrop of the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (Japan), Germany reached a broad consensus to amend the Atomic Energy Act,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> and thereby abandon the use of nuclear energy by 2022.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> In conjunction with this amendment, seven further legislative proposals from the federal government were adopted, aiming to bring about a new era of energy policy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a> Germany’s decision was clearly the outcome of a concerted process. The ISDS system thus seems to make countries pay for reasonable democratic choices.  This case caused specific backlash in German society because <em>Vattenfall</em> was able to circumvent three levels of jurisdiction: national, EU and ECHR, two of which Germany shared with Sweden.   </p>

<p>Secondly, the very prospect of being challenged before an investment tribunal has chilling effects on sovereign states’ ability to exercise their authority, an effect which goes beyond the fiscal cost of defending disputes. Indeed, the investment regime, by enabling foreign companies to challenge national measures before an investment tribunal, causes chilling effects both directly (when the threat of investment dispute deters government action) and indirectly (when a country may decide to refrain from adopting a specific measure because it is already involved in numerous disputes).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> This may lead to a ‘systemic’ chill where policy-making incorporates an assessment of the potential risks of an investment dispute.  </p>

<p>One may counter the preceding argument by highlighting that sovereign states are not coerced into entering BITs. As such, being bound by BITs would equally be an expression of national political will, and undermining these international agreements would also amount to thwarting political ownership over decision-making.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> This argument would be defensible if sovereign states knew exactly the scope of the consequences derived from signing up to BITs. However, as noted above, where legal reciprocity was always a feature of BITs, the factual and economic reciprocity of investment flows has only emerged in recent years. </p>

<p>This is in part due to the economic emergence of developing economies which, in turn, started issuing foreign direct investments.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> The UNCTAD studied this issue, noting that where developing economies emitted 14% of the world’s share of FDI in the world in 1995, they represented 21% of the world share in 2009,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> a trend that has since continued to rise. In 2014, developing and transitioning economies accounted for 38% of the world share in FDI.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> A significant portion of this FDI is in fact directed towards developed economies. </p>

<p>In correlation to this increase, developing countries have appeared with increasing frequency before ISDS tribunals in investment disputes. Whereas in 2012 only 11% of claimants hailed from developing or transition economies,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a> the number has increasingly surged, amounting to 32% in 2018.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> Importantly, many of these cases have been brought against developed economies. In an era where Portugal has actively encouraged investment from Angola into its public utilities sector,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37</a> the prospect of developed states defending their policies before investment tribunals has become increasingly likely. </p>

<p>But the emergence of legal reciprocity in investment flows is also attributable to developed states inadvertently agreeing upon investment chapters among themselves. The case in point is the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT),<a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38</a> which was initially viewed as a multilateral treaty safeguarding EU investments in Eastern European states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> As Alvarez notes, after more than a decade the EU realised that the ECT could be used by EU companies to protect foreign investments in fellow member states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> This was particularly shocking as it amounted to circumventing the common EU level investment legislation.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a></p>

<p>Historical contingency played a significant role in creating this rare occurrence in international law – by no means do sovereign states regularly commit such consequential errors when reaching international agreements. The Lisbon Treaty, concluded in 2009, provided that all intra-EU investment disputes would be submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> As such, it had the effect of terminating many pre-existing intra-EU BITs, given their incompatibility with EU law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> The Lisbon Treaty, however, was unable to terminate the ECT, which had entered into force in 1998, specifically because it was not a strictly intra-EU BIT. Indeed, the ECT is a binding international treaty that not only includes all of the EU Member States, but also a number of third states.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> This seemingly anecdotal legal episode has since yielded tremendous consequences for the ISDS system. The UNCTAD estimates that the ECT was invoked in 20% of all investor-state arbitrations world-wide,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline45" href="#45">45</a> making it the single most frequently invoked mechanism for ISDS.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline46" href="#46">46</a> Of these ECT disputes to date, 64% were strictly intra-EU.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline47" href="#47">47</a></p>

<p>What this particular situation reveals is the extent to which states sometimes cannot anticipate the full ambit of international mechanisms to which they subscribe. In any case, it is manifest that the ISDS system, through reverse discrimination, challenges sovereign states’ political ownership over their laws and regulations. Therefore, the ISDS system undermines a core feature of stable constitutions.</p>

<h5 id="iii-how-does-reverse-discrimination-undermine-freedom-and-equality-amongst-actors"><u>(iii) How does reverse discrimination undermine freedom and equality amongst actors?</u></h5>

<p>As Jan Kleinheisterkamp argues, ISDS grants greater rights to foreign investors than to national investors: this undermines states’ democratic commitment to equality of rights, and means that domestic companies do not have the same freedom to act as their domestic counterparts.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline48" href="#48">48</a> The ‘greater rights’ granted to foreign investors manifest themselves in several ways: (i) they allow the foreign investor to explore an avenue for redress which the national investor cannot explore, (ii) they enable foreign investors to claim limitless awards by circumventing the limits that operate on compensation in domestic courts and (iii) they also enable foreign investors to enter into contracts with states without facing the same political risk that a national company would face. Kelsey et al. note that this inequality of rights amongst economic actors significantly distorts market relations in favour of foreign companies: having the ISDS outlet means that the amount of risk incorporated in their investment decisions is largely inferior compared to their domestic counterparts.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline49" href="#49">49</a></p>

<p>In an attempt to counter this observation, Christian Riffel, amongst others, posits that ISDS does not undermine states’ commitments to equality before the law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline50" href="#50">50</a> Two broad types of arguments are made to this end. </p>

<h6 id="the-first-line-of-counter-argument"><u>The first line of counter-argument</u></h6>

<p>The first line of argument suggests that applying the same rules to national and foreign investors is not desirable since they are in materially different positions to start off with.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline51" href="#51">51</a> It therefore sees carving out a specific regime for foreign investors as a way of balancing out the starting positions. An example of this initial difference is the specific due diligence imposed on foreign companies by acts such as the Enterprise Act,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline52" href="#52">52</a> when entering the UK market.</p>

<p>The investment protection system seeks to eliminate this initial difference by implementing standards in international investment treaties which are ’functionally comparable to constitutional guarantees and administrative law principles at the domestic level’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline53" href="#53">53</a> Kleinheisterkamp refers to this as following a ‘logic of substitution’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline54" href="#54">54</a> Foreign investors are not subjected to national judicial procedures which may discriminate against them unfairly – rather, the national procedures are ‘substituted’ by an international procedure which emulates the way national procedures would work for domestic companies. This artificial mechanism thereby intends to cut all discrimination out of the process. </p>

<p>In practice, however, carving out a separate regime for foreign investors does not necessarily have the desired effect of replicating national procedures. One reason for this points to the multitude of different national procedures, and the impossibility for the international regime to reflect all of these accurately. Indeed, each domestic jurisdiction strikes its own subtle balance between ‘the private interests of investors and the public interests of host states.’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline55" href="#55">55</a> The provisions encapsulated in BITs are unable to reflect these specific balances because they frame standards of protection in general and open-textured language. It is almost a trite fact that standards of judicial review such as ‘fair and equitable treatment’, ‘full protection and security’ and ‘indirect expropriation’ are highly vague and can be given different content depending on the case at hand, and the panel hearing it. In the Suez case, the UNCITRAL reflected this point by highlighting that the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard can only be defined by terms of ‘almost equal vagueness’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline56" href="#56">56</a> This mismatch between ‘general’ standards in BITs and ‘specific’ balances on the national level reveals the practical impossibility for investment treaty law to satisfy the ‘logic of substitution’ that forms its guiding principle. </p>

<p>A second related reason why carving out a separate regime for foreign investors through BITs does not effectively replicate national procedures is that at times, investment treaty law creates more favourable conditions for foreign investors than would be available under national law for domestic companies. This problem of ‘reverse discrimination’ is a direct consequence of the aforementioned vagueness of BIT standards, and of the important discretion that investment tribunals have in ascribing content to these provisions. Because of this latitude, individual tribunals can confer awards to foreign investors where equivalent awards would not be available to domestic companies appearing before national courts.  The case in point is <em>Vattenfall</em>:<a class="inline-reference" id="inline57" href="#57">57</a> had Vattenfall been a domestic company, it would plainly have not been able to recoup its investment. Importantly, the decision in <em>Vattenfall</em> does not represent a one-off anomaly but falls within a broader trend. A couple of salient examples are the cases of <em>Masdar v. Spain<a class="inline-reference" id="inline58" href="#58">58</a></em> and <em>Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador<a class="inline-reference" id="inline59" href="#59">59</a></em>, which replicate the <em>Vattenfall</em> format, enabling foreign investors to benefit from ISDS in a way which was unavailable to domestic companies.</p>

<p>This is not to say that investment treaty law systematically creates inverse discrimination in favour of foreign investors – in many occasions, international investment tribunals are able to track national procedures. In this sense, Lowe is not exactly right when he asserts that ’the consequence is plain and inescapable. BITs give foreign investors wider rights than nationals possess’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline60" href="#60">60</a> Rather, BITs create the <em>potential</em> for foreign investors to have wider rights than nationals possess. However, what matters for the purposes of our analysis is that this potential exists – and that this potential sometimes comes to fruition. Indeed, what this demonstrates is that the separate regime for foreign investors does not, and cannot, successfully and systematically replicate national procedures. The potential for reverse discrimination inherent to investment treaty law therefore means that it does not, as Riffel suggests, successfully correct the initial imbalance between national and foreign investors. Their unequal position in front of the law is maintained.</p>

<p>Moreover, this line of argument which supports the separate system of investment treaty law for foreign investors is also flawed because it does not account for the idea that a company’s choice to enter a foreign market carries an inherent responsibility to adhere by domestic laws.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline61" href="#61">61</a> These are considerations that should be internalised by companies when they decide to make a foreign direct investment. </p>

<h6 id="the-second-line-of-counter-argument"><u>The second line of counter-argument</u></h6>

<p>The second line of argument posits that in practice, there is no material difference between the treatment of foreign companies under investment treaty law and that of domestic companies under domestic law, and therefore it would be erroneous to view investment treaty law as creating inequality.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline62" href="#62">62</a> The example given for this point is that ’domestic law may make available the same remedies as an international investment agreement’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline63" href="#63">63</a> Viewed alongside the first line of argument, it seems that supporters of ISDS are trying to have it both ways. Riffel stresses that investment treaty law both creates and doesn’t create inequality.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline64" href="#64">64</a> More importantly, as Kleinheisterkamp highlights, although in theory domestic remedies do exist, in practice the domestic paths to accessing such remedies are much more saturated than they are for investment tribunals.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline65" href="#65">65</a> As such, it would be plainly incorrect to assert that both investment tribunals and domestic courts lead to equal outcomes.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that ISDS, structured to create reverse discrimination, compromises national constitutional commitments to freedom and equality of all actors before the law. </p>

<h5 id="iv-constitutional-compromising-why-now"><u>(iv) Constitutional compromising: why now?</u></h5>

<p>What transpires from this analysis is that the very logic of investment treaty law, which carves out a different regime for foreign investors, undermines the central tenets of a stable and legitimate constitution within a polity: (i) political ownership over common rules and (ii) freedom and equality of all actors before the law. The ISDS’s substantive legitimacy crisis stems from its inherent incompatibility with the core constitutional values within states. </p>

<p>Yet, one may ponder why it is only now that the birth defects in the system are coming to the surface and creating a substantive legitimacy crisis. The first reason, detailed above, is that the legal reciprocity of BITs is only now accompanied by reciprocal investment flows. This is the case between developed and developing nations, but also between developing nations themselves.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline66" href="#66">66</a> This trend has been accelerated by recent cases, such as <em>Masdar v Spain</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline67" href="#67">67</a> where an increasingly broad interpretation of ‘investment’ has been adopted. Whereas ‘investment’ used to be reserved for significant transnational acquisitions of property, the term now seems vague enough to capture ordinary commercial transactions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline68" href="#68">68</a> Indeed, as Tim Samples demonstrates, economic and technological developments have changed the nature of investments, and therefore changed the definition of ‘investment’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline69" href="#69">69</a> Early generation BITs could not envisage, in their drafting, the current scope of investment treaty law.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline70" href="#70">70</a></p>

<p>The second reason is that a number of landmark cases in the last few decades have shown that investment treaty law is being exploited by Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to avoid accountability in host states. One such case is <em>Methanex Corporation v. the United States</em> which raised this point in light of environmental rules.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline71" href="#71">71</a> In the late 1990s, a Canadian investor sued the United States because California had banned certain additives to car fuel for the protection of the environment. The idea that a foreign company could sue the United States because California was trying to protect its environment and public health caused a huge uproar in the United States – the matter was hotly debated by the House of Representatives.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline72" href="#72">72</a>  Although in this case the investment tribunal ruled in favour of the United States, it opened the floodgates to foreign investors challenging domestic laws in ISDS. A number of more recent cases have been won by investors challenging national environmental regulations,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline73" href="#73">73</a> but also challenging regulations in a host of other policy areas. These include cases on essential services,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline74" href="#74">74</a> financial stability,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline75" href="#75">75</a> and development and industrial policy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline76" href="#76">76</a> Such decisions have, in the past decade, increased attention on the investment treaty regime’s role in undermining national accountability. Doing so has revealed the substantive challenges to the system’s structural legitimacy.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline77" href="#77">77</a>  </p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The ISDS system’s substantive legitimacy crisis is caused by the inherent logic of the system itself – for this reason, it simply cannot become legitimate. Threatening to increasingly undermine constitutional commitments at the national level, it is urgent for the regime as a whole to be repealed. Only through such drastic measures will the substantive challenges posed by ISDS be addressed. The EU has started to realise the extent of the problem posed by reverse discrimination. Following the ECJ ruling in <em>Achmea</em>,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline78" href="#78">78</a> where it was declared that Intra-EU BITs were contrary to EU law, 23 EU Member states (all except Austria, Ireland, Finland and Sweden) have signed on 5 May 2020 the ‘Agreement for the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Member States of the European Union’. What such an agreement will reap is uncertain, but its existence certainly does signal a formal recognition of the substantive challenges contained in the ISDS regime.</p>

	     <h5 id="abstract">Abstract</h5>

<p><em>The economic fallout from the novel coronavirus is being felt worldwide. As a consequence, the international market chain has experienced imminent delays in performance of contractual obligations. An existing uniform international regime which can provide for effective enforceability and renegotiation of asset-based contracts is UNIDROIT: its Principles on Commercial Contracts, the Cape Town Convention, and related protocols.</em></p>

<p><em>In this context, we argue the case for the majority, the underrepresented and the most affected in this scenario: the debtors/lessors in the transport sector. We contend that the current financial crisis can be improved by adopting the alternatives that UNIDROIT instruments provide.</em></p>

<p><em>In furtherance, the three parts of our article purport to provide: i) a contextual overview of the economic impact of COVID-19 on Airlines and Railways; ii) an analysis of the condition of the Airlines and the Railway industries using the UNIDROIT documents which govern the legal aspects of this issue; and finally iii) plausible solutions to reduce this economic burden.</em></p>

<h5 id="1-unidroit-an-overview-of-the-existing-norms"><strong>1. UNIDROIT: An Overview of the Existing Norms</strong></h5>

<p>UNIDROIT’s Principles of International Commercial Contracts establish a legal framework to articulate the principles underlying asset-based financing and leasing, and protect other such related interests.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline1" href="#1">1</a></p>

<p>Similarly, the Cape Town Convention and its Protocols are standardised rules to be followed while engaging in transnational business transactions. Specific to mobile equipment, the Convention lays down certain objectives to facilitate asset-based financing and leasing, protect the interests of all parties, and create a legal framework for international interests. The most significant aspect of the Cape Town Convention is the trifurcation between air, railway, and space assets, creating a comprehensive yet definite framework for each.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline2" href="#2">2</a></p>

<p>The Luxembourg Protocol utilizes the Cape Town Convention as a baseline while accommodating the specific requirements of the railway industry, integrating these elements in a vital transnational instrument. </p>

<h5 id="2-the-impact-factor"><strong>2. The Impact Factor</strong></h5>

<p>The recent COVID-19 health crisis has had a profound impact on all forms of travel and transportation. Both the aviation and railway sectors have been significant casualties of the worldwide shutdowns of domestic and cross-border trade and travel.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline3" href="#3">3</a></p>

<p>The most significant impact on airline companies has been due to a slump in demand among travellers as a result of the multiple travel restrictions. Several airlines have declared bankruptcy,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline4" href="#4">4</a> many have ceased operations, while other airlines reported a reduction in flights after a decade of expansion.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline5" href="#5">5</a> Statistics show that, on an average, 10% of flights around the world   were cancelled in early March 2020, in stark contrast to 2019.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline6" href="#6">6</a> As the pandemic gained traction in late March, the recorded flight movements reduced almost 40–60% with international flights being affected the most. Unfortunately, research also shows that global recovery of passenger demand to pre-COVID-19 levels is estimated to take almost two years, with the most optimistic loss estimate being a whopping USD 84 billion (GBP 63.23 billion).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline7" href="#7">7</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, estimates on the railway sector suggest that the fallout from the health crisis will cause global rail passenger revenue losses to the tune of USD 60 billion (GBP 45 billion) in 2020 and further seep into 2021.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline8" href="#8">8</a> The freight sector alone is expected to lose approximately USD 26 billion (GBP 19.5 billion) this year.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline9" href="#9">9</a></p>

<p>Statistics from both sectors put into perspective the scale of the financial blowback being experienced by operators, investors and financial institutions. This situation has a direct impact on leasing agreements as well, as lessors will look to prematurely terminate agreements due to factors like non-payment. During these tumultuous times, the interests of various stakeholders in the concerned industry must be protected. This is where UNIDROIT’s instruments offer effective solutions.</p>

<h5 id="3-airlines"><strong>3. AIRLINES</strong></h5>

<h5 id="31-flying-and-non-performance"><u>3.1. Flying and Non-Performance<u></u></u></h5>

<p>COVID-19 has caused the termination of contractual relations, mainly due to the breach of obligations and pulling-out by major global investors from industries that were once the benchmark for stock-market performance. Primarily, the virus has devastated airlines, giving creditors or investor-firms like Berkshire Hathaway no incentive to hold on to their airline stakes.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline10" href="#10">10</a> Firms have sold shares as they anticipated a huge risk sending the entire industry into a competitive spiral that could potentially damage profits, sales, and investor returns.</p>

<p>We argue that nations must therefore collectively reinstate investor optimism to help airline shares take-off. Hence, we aim to begin the discussion by <strong>i)</strong> highlighting the main UNIDROIT principles and providing our perspectives on the frustration of payment obligations by airlines, <strong>ii)</strong> elaborating on the legal protections and remedies that the UNIDROIT Convention on the International Interests in Mobile Equipment provides to affected parties.</p>

<h5 id="i-airline-payment-obligations-and-unidroit"><u>i) Airline Payment Obligations and UNIDROIT</u></h5>

<p>Aeroplanes require high-maintenance, a process that runs up millions of dollars  in costs.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline11" href="#11">11</a> Periodic maintenance is not cheap either; it demands investment in building and maintaining terminals at large airports.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline12" href="#12">12</a> Airlines pay fees to airports to rent their gates and slots, which binds them to long-term contracts with operators. They are also locked into third party contractor agreements to hedge jet fuel prices.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline13" href="#13">13</a> Yet, the impossibility of performing their part of such contracts is not rare for airline companies. Therefore, UNIDROIT Principles (“Principles”) of International Commercial Contracts may take effect in suitable scenarios, and attempt to prevent global economies from periodic busts, protecting airlines’ legal rights.</p>

<h5 id="a-applicable-principles-hardship-v-force-majeure"><u>a) Applicable Principles:</u><strong><em><u> Hardship v. Force Majeure</u></em></strong></h5>

<p>A plain reading of the document reveals that the text of these Principles must serve as a model for national legislators. To that end, a comprehensive textual understanding is needed.</p>

<p>The relevant provisions for consideration are: Article 6.2.2 of the document<a class="inline-reference" id="inline14" href="#14">14</a>, which defines ‘hardship’; Article 7.1.7<a class="inline-reference" id="inline15" href="#15">15</a> which defines <em>force majeure</em>; and Comment 6 on Article 6.2.2<a class="inline-reference" id="inline16" href="#16">16</a> which deliberates the possibility of both occurring together. In this context, COVID-19 would become a ‘hardship’ (by virtue of it being an event beyond the control of the disadvantaged party) and a <em>force majeure</em> (as such an impediment could not have been taken into account at the time of conclusion of the contract).</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in <em>Churchill Falls v. Hydro-Québec</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline17" href="#17">17</a>, recently provided clarity on the first aspect: ‘hardship’. Notwithstanding that the facts of the case did not admit the adoption of the above-stated Principles, the judgment articulated important lessons on the broader obligations of contracting parties and reimposed parties’ right of renegotiation. The decision reads in the context of COVID-19, ‘…for example, in a situation of ‘hardship’ that corresponds to the description of that concept set out in the UNIDROIT Principles, the conduct of the contracting party who benefits from the change in circumstances <em>cannot be disregarded and must be assessed</em>’ (emphasis added).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline18" href="#18">18</a> The Court also noted that an inflexible or a ‘gratuitously impatient or intransigent’ party, in these exigent circumstances, would violate the good faith duty under equity.</p>

<p>On the second aspect of <em>force majeure,</em> courts in India and other countries have generally construed that impossibility of performance pursuant to an unforeseeable event is a suitable justification in restraining specific performance obligations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline19" href="#19">19</a> Where Scottish or English regimes are concerned, the decision would not only depend on the circumstances but also on the drafting of the particular contractual provisions.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline20" href="#20">20</a> This position is similar in Singapore as well.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline21" href="#21">21</a></p>

<p>However, in a factual situation where both ‘hardship’ and <em>force majeure</em> occur, as contemplated in Comment 6 of Article 6.2.2, we suggest that invoking hardship would be the best choice. Carrier organisations may need to re-evaluate the legitimate hazard that may emerge under their agreements with third-party contractors, for activities including refuelling, providing food, runway development and repairs, aeroplane maintenance and upgrades, and flight dispatches.</p>

<p>Therefore, if airlines invoke ‘hardship’ under the Principles as the rationale behind breach, they can expect not only that their non-performance be excused, but also that the terms of such long-term contracts be renegotiated for the purpose of keeping the contract alive, albeit on revised terms. These relaxations would allow them short-term benefits like improved cash-flow, as well as achieving long-term goals such as general restructuring.</p>

<h5 id="ii-suggestions-for-a-new-lease-of-life"><u>ii) Suggestions for a New Lease of Life</u></h5>

<p>This section details the protections and remedies that may be sought by airline debtors and lessors.</p>

<p>Firstly, given that the carrier organisations have suspended their businesses, it is necessary to determine if defaults would be triggered under the various financial understandings entered into by these companies. Where an occasion of default is triggered upon a <em>deliberate</em> suspension of business, such an interruption is generally an immediate outcome of governmental guidelines. That would be outside the scope of such an agreement, and fall under the purview of the Cape Town Convention.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is necessary to ascertain if an occasion of default is qualified by the ‘material adverse change’<a class="inline-reference" id="inline22" href="#22">22</a> requirement. This would reflect on the borrower’s capacity to play out their legally binding commitments. In the event that there is a critical effect on the borrower’s capacity to pay, this will probably fulfil the widely used test of ‘material adverse change’.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline23" href="#23">23</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, it is normal that post-COVID-19 and after the lifting of lockdown orders, for reasons including budgetary and operational challenges, carrier organisations will be unable to immediately resume operations in all regions or may not be in a situation to recommission their fleets. Considering this, it would be suitable for nations to survey the occasion of default and the cessation of business in their financial agreements involving security interests.</p>

<p>It could be contended that impermanent terminations post-COVID-19 would establish said cessation of business.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline24" href="#24">24</a> Subsequently, it would be judicious for nations to introduce policies aligned with the Cape Town Convention, to allow aircraft organisations to audit their facility agreements, while considering COVID-19 related measures and the effect such measures may have on their financing plans.</p>

<p>Fourthly and finally, the carrier organisations may consider approaching their lessors for concessions according to their respective rent commitments (by virtue of the liquidity crunch resulting in falling ticket demand).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline25" href="#25">25</a> For instance, the largest domestic airline in India InterGlobe Aviation Limited, which operates IndiGo’s fleet, has received 50% relief on supplementary rent, generally used to cover maintenance costs, as the greater part of IndiGo’s fleet remains grounded due to COVD-19.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline26" href="#26">26</a></p>

<p>While the lessors might be qualified to make decay demands for such concessions on rent commitments, the Convention would prevent them from doing so and would also give the lessee some leeway in these unprecedented times. Therefore, it will be advantageous to consider the alleviation bundle or concessions which a carrier organisation looks for from the lessors and which must incorporate a concurred period, with a specific amount of reimbursement to recover the unpaid rents. Such patience on occasion of default can therefore come at an expense, like delayed repayment, but also be highly beneficial to the lessees.</p>

<h5 id="32-the-road-ahead"><u>3.2. The Road Ahead<u></u></u></h5>

<p>For the industry to get back on track, states must ensure the provision of credit-financing for aviation assets to alleviate the circumstances that the increasingly bankrupt airline industry faces. Secondly, the borrowing costs must be revised and decreased in accordance with the Principles to enable economic regrowth. Thirdly, the continuous cooperation of states will ensure that consumer demand for commercial aircraft increases, thereby effectuating increased transnational air travel.</p>

<p>In the context of the judiciary and their interference in commercial contract matters, tempered literal interpretations of certain contracts have to be effected in order to protect the underlying obligations intended by the parties. Good faith confers a broad, flexible power to create law, which helps tie various legal principles to the concept of fundamental justice, depending on the circumstances, in an effort to protect contractual equilibrium.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline27" href="#27">27</a> In the same vein, the fundamentally altered equilibrium in the aviation sector has to be set right, and nations should ratify documents such as the UNIDROIT’s Principles and render justice to those industries who are exposed to a substantially greater risk than others.</p>

<h5 id="4-railways"><strong>4. RAILWAYS</strong></h5>

<h5 id="41-addressing-financial-concerns-in-the-railway-sector"><u>4.1. Addressing financial concerns in the Railway sector<u></u></u></h5>

<p>The railway sector plays a pivotal role in keeping the gears of the global economy turning. It is estimated that by 2025, the global rolling stock market size will reach USD 75 billion (equivalent to GBP 57.1 billion).<a class="inline-reference" id="inline28" href="#28">28</a> These numbers illustrate the sheer scale on which railways operate and, more importantly, they highlight the need for adequate safeguards for investments. This section is devoted to three aspects in this regard: i) highlighting the scope of the Luxembourg Protocol, ii) enumerating the liquidity crisis among operators, and iii) addressing the remedies it provides on insolvency. </p>

<h5 id="-42scope-of-the-luxembourg-protocol"><u> 4.2.Scope of the Luxembourg Protocol<u></u></u></h5>

<p>The Luxembourg Rail Protocol (Protocol) was ratified in 2007, using The Cape Town Convention as a broad framework, while taking into account the specific requirements of the rail industry.</p>

<p>The objective of the Protocol has been interpreted as follows: ‘<em>It seeks to facilitate, worldwide, more extensive private sector finance for rolling stock, reduce barriers to entry to the rail sector, and resolve important cross-border legal issues as a result of more diverse, extensive and less expensive private sector finance for railway rolling stock.’</em><a class="inline-reference" id="inline29" href="#29">29</a></p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the Protocol addresses two immediate concerns in the rail sector, namely default remedies and registry provisions. Under the former, it enumerates remedies on insolvency, insolvency assistance, and provisions for debtors. The latter concern, on the other hand, encapsulates: the authority of the registrar, designation of entry points, identification of rolling stock, and notices of sale. With a wide scope in terms of its application, the Protocol has an important role to play in combating the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h5 id="i-mitigating-the-liquidity-crisis"><u>i) Mitigating the liquidity crisis</u></h5>

<p>During this crisis, certain issues have taken precedence. Low foot and freight traffic have prompted a liquidity crisis and pushed operators towards a staggering loss of revenue.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline30" href="#30">30</a> States have been actively involved in assisting their railways over the past few years, and more so since the beginning of COVID-19.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline31" href="#31">31</a> The French government absorbed EUR 35 million (GBP 31 billions) of debt from SNCF in 2018,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline32" href="#32">32</a> and will help out the national operator again this financial year.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline33" href="#33">33</a> According to the Office of National Statistics of the UK, British train companies have effectively been re-nationalised temporarily to survive,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline34" href="#34">34</a> and Angela Merkel and the Bundestag have sought to raise the debt ceiling of the German Deutsche Bahn to cope with the crisis.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline35" href="#35">35</a></p>

<p>While state-owned firms have more leeway, private entities are left to fend for themselves. Union Pacific has reported its worst quarter since the 2008 Financial Crisis,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline36" href="#36">36</a> while both Canadian National and CSX experienced 18.9 and 26% drops in revenue respectively.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline37" href="#37">37,</a><a class="inline-reference" id="inline38" href="#38">38,</a><a class="inline-reference" id="inline39" href="#39">39</a> Amtrak saw a mammoth 95% drop in ridership,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline40" href="#40">40</a> pushing an already loss-saturated entity into restructuring its operations. Amidst the chaos, states and operators are looking for any sort of relief from incessant financial pressure.</p>

<h5 id="43-remedies-on-insolvency-and-their-applications-during-the-pandemic"><u>4.3 Remedies on insolvency and their applications during the pandemic<u></u></u></h5>

<p>The Protocol presents three different alternatives for creditors and debtors in situations where insolvency may occur.</p>

<p>In the first alternative,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline41" href="#41">41</a> the insolvency administrator shall give possession of the rolling stock to the creditor upon default. This represents a safety net for creditors as, if the debtor’s position becomes untenable, they may take possession of tangible assets. However, there is a reasonable waiting period for the debtor to put across their case. The debtor is not precluded from using the rolling stock, as long as its value does not depreciate through such use. Most importantly, the debtor can retain possession of the rolling stock if it cures all the defaults other than a default constituted by the opening of insolvency proceedings, and has agreed to perform all future obligations under the agreement and related transaction document within the waiting period. </p>

<p>The second alternative allows the debtor to issue a notice to the creditor,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline42" href="#42">42</a> stating its position with regards to meeting its financial obligations or allow the creditor to take possession of the stock. This option gives debtors the chance to represent their situation to creditors.</p>

<p>The final option prescribes a period within which the debtor agrees to cure all defaults and agrees to perform all future obligations.<a class="inline-reference" id="inline43" href="#43">43</a> The assets are turned over to the creditor upon a failure to do so. Prior to the completion of this cure period, the debtor is also empowered to approach a court seeking a stay on repossession of the assets, provided they can fulfil their obligations to the creditor during such suspension period.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that each contract is unique and therefore a singular solution can cause friction between the involved parties. These alternatives therefore provide three comprehensive courses of action. In the context of the current situation, the second and third alternatives are of utmost relevance. As various operators face liquidity crunches, it is practically impossible for them to meet their immediate debt obligations. Additionally, Article X of the Protocol also provides for insolvency assistance requiring courts in the contracting state to cooperate with foreign bodies and jurisdictions, which would prove to be conducive to dealing with the situation at hand.</p>

<p>However, a gradual pickup of traffic seems likely. Debtors can, therefore, likely transfer their risk to the creditors, with assurances that the situation will improve. Should a reasonable cure period be negotiated, it would ensure that debtors have adequate time to cure their obligations without sacrificing the creditors’ stakes in the operation.</p>

<h5 id="44-using-the-protocol-efficiently-to-manage-the-crisis-a-suggestion"><u>4.4 Using the Protocol efficiently to manage the crisis: A Suggestion<u></u></u></h5>

<p>Ultimately, the aforementioned statistics are just a small insight into the magnitude of COVID-19’s impact. Even the most optimistic estimates do not suggest a strong pickup of economic growth before the second half of 2021,<a class="inline-reference" id="inline44" href="#44">44</a> and railways across the globe will continue to face contractions before a gruelling recovery.</p>

<p>Hence, debtors need to be protected from financial ruin by using the relevant insolvency provisions. At the same time, this cannot compromise on the interests of creditors. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the relevant alternatives provided by the Protocol, in order to find one that meets the expectations of all parties. Additionally, the international registry must facilitate large-scale coordination between parties. By providing pertinent information about rolling stock, the registry must aid parties in making informed decisions about the procurement, sale, and movement of such stock. On this, the Protocol has been ratified to protect the interests of various players in the field, and the pandemic could very well be its hour of reckoning.</p>

<h5 id="5-conclusion"><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></h5>

<p>The problems we have addressed arise primarily from the fact that legal systems have various approaches to securities and lease agreements, which creates uncertainty for lending institutions and borrowers regarding the efficacy of their rights. This issue can be dealt with, summarily, by adopting the foregoing measures.</p>

<p>Therefore, amidst the uncertainty around the pandemic, the implementation of the UNIDROIT Principles will be pivotal to ensure that air operators can stem the haemorrhage of money and that they will be able to return to normalcy once the crisis ends. To manage the fallout from the pandemic, the Luxembourg Protocol must be utilized to its fullest in order to provide an equitable, comprehensive and efficient method to manage the fallout from the pandemic while preparing entities to return to their normal capacities.</p>

<p>It would also be prudent to encourage a greater number of states to ratify the Cape Town Convention and its protocols in order to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive system of investment protection. We believe that the adoption of such principles for special needs during extraordinary circumstances would lead to a better global understanding of broader concepts like contractual stability and fairness: concepts which UNIDROIT has championed in the international arena.</p>
