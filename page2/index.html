    "title": "Individualisation in Contractual Interpretation",
    "body": "2021/05/29 - Introduction: The area of contract interpretation has been heavily discussed in light of the Court’s seemingly conflicting case law on the shift towards the contextual approach. In particular, several commentators have wondered if the courts have taken a step back towards the traditional, textual approach after making giant strides towards contextualism. 1 This essay shall seek to unify the conflicting case law on contract interpretation under a single, coherent theory of ‘individualisation’. Such a theory will illustrate that the court’s recent judgments have focused on enhancing the ‘freedom’ of the individual in achieving their own particular interpretation of the contract. While this article’s scope does not address how the ‘individualisation’ theory applies to all other doctrines of contract law, individualisation still rests on general liberal principles, which should serve as a good starting point for analysing the other doctrines. The article shall thus narrow its focus to only discuss individualisation within the context of interpretation.   A (Grand) Theory of Contract Law?: Before the article can proceed with discussion of the recent case law on contract interpretation, it will briefly discuss general theories of contract law. History begins not with a particular theory, but the oft-cited doctrine of ‘freedom of contract’. Central to the idea of freedom of contract was individual autonomy and its promotion through the realm of contract law. 2 Free from interference by the courts and the government, contract law merely serves as the ‘vehicle’ for the courts to enforce contracts as the parties had intended. 3 This distinctly liberal concept of contract law continues to pervade English jurisprudence, despite its supposed decline since the early 20^th^ century. 4 Meanwhile, liberalism became the predominant mode of contract law theories, and in 1981, Charles Fried published his seminal work Contract as Promise5in defence of a liberal contract law. Here, Fried’s theory will serve as an excellent starting point for analysis given its preeminent status as a modern defence of liberalism in contract law, and importantly because it couches contract law within the realm of morality. This can be contrasted with other, more practical theories of contract6 which may lack sufficient normative strength in justifying the operation of contract law.  Given the article’s intention to propose a unifying theory of contract interpretation based on liberal principles, it would also be helpful to examine the value of liberal theories through Fried’s work. To understand the significance of Fried’s theory, we must first distinguish between ‘foundationalist’ and ‘conventionalist’ theories of contract law. Saprai provides an excellent summary of the key differences: the former “presupposes a deontological moral outlook as a mode of justifying” contract law; while the latter serves “purely epistemic” ends and is more descriptive of contract law so as to make it more “digestible, predictable” and practicable. 7 Before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each school, it should be noted that the theory this article proposes will not simply be a descriptive and ‘epistemic’ theory, and instead intends to justify why the courts have chosen to develop the doctrine of interpretation in the manner they did. Regardless, the advantage of foundationalist theories is that they enhance the legitimacy of the operation of contract law doctrines by grounding them within a single principle, while conventionalist theories merely see contract law as an “arbitrary collection of doctrines”. 8 Foundationalism also brings greater unity, as well as coherence to contract law and can help in predicting future developments of contract law (assuming that the theory is accurate). 9 Lastly, as a standard of justification for contract law doctrines, it sets clear limits to the powers of the court when furthering the development of contract law. 10 While conventionalist theories may be more practical insofar as they are able to better account for inconsistencies within the Court’s approach, it is only because they accept developments of the law as matters of fact and do not critically analyse the Court’s jurisprudence. They can thus barely be called ‘theories’ of contract law. Moving on to Fried, he proposes the idea of ‘promise’ as the foundational concept of contract law. Thus, promise transcends all communitarian understandings of contract law, and contract law ought to affirm promise because it is the basis by which individuals as “free and autonomous agents both serve their own ends and respect the humanity of other free autonomous agents”. 11 Its key contribution to theories of contract law is therefore its respect of the “liberal ideal”, that any and all action must have some “terms and limits according to which we strive”. 12 This provides a powerful basis for both justifying, as well as limiting the development of contract law. Given this, how would the theory function in practice? Saprai states that ‘promise’ as a foundationalist theory must operate in one of three ways: (1) as a necessity in any contract law doctrine (necessity); (2) as the primary principle behind doctrines (primacy); or (3) as a presumption of the validity of doctrines (presumptiveness). [13 In summary, the first two suggestions can be prima facie rejected due to their incompatibility with modern contract law. 14 It is clear that not all contract law doctrines are justified based on the sanctity of promises, and to hold so would be to inaccurately describe the justifications behind such doctrines. Presumptiveness however, is more difficult to reject from the outset. It minimally recognises the existence as well as primacy of other principles, but still acts as the central principle justifying contract law. 15 Yet, even such an accommodating perspective of promise fails to account properly for the actual relevance of other principles such as justice and fairness, which take centre stage in doctrines where promise plays little to no part (such as statutory implied terms). Since presumptions are inherently epistemic, i. e. , that all doctrines should converge with the principle unless justified otherwise, it again serves as the first barrier of contract law doctrines when there is no reason to subsume them under promise in the first place. 16 It is thus doubly undesirable: (1) it is a weaker form of primacy, failing to truly elevate promise as the principle of contract law; and (2) does not accord proper respect to alternative deontic principles of contract law. Further criticism of Fried’s theory takes the form of practicability and functionality. Kostritsky argues that the promise theory, naturally being deontological, removes itself from the normative aspects of contract law – the purpose and reasons for the system of contracting, and why it is so valued in society. 17 The theory ultimately fails to account for an “understanding of the [contracting] parties’ goals” and is unable to “craft rules which will work in reality”. 18 However, given that the theory was not meant to be epistemic in nature, is the exclusion of contract’s functional role justified? As stated above, Fried’s theory is able to transcend communitarian understandings of contract law doctrines, and therefore protects contract law from arbitrariness and the majoritarian will (and abuse) of the community. 19 Despite this, the theory still lacks normative pull given that other principles of contract law also aim to protect contract law from arbitrariness and majoritarian abuse; failing to recognise the plurality of these other principles also harms its credibility as a theory. Moreover, promise’s weight as a moral justification is arguably lacking – beyond literal pacta sunt servanda, promises hold little moral strength and fall flat in their attempt to justify judicial enforcement (or lack thereof). 20 As has often been argued, autonomy does not simply mean non-interference, but also extends to the ability to choose freely from amongst many valid choices (including the ability to exit unfavourable circumstances). 21 Promise Theory: An Alternative?: Given the above conclusions, are there any competing theories that may bridge the lacunae identified in Fried’s promise theory? How might the significance of foundationalist theories be maintained while accommodating for the functional and pluralist nature of other contract law theories? For this, we look no further than Saprai’s third understanding of promise theory: presumptiveness. While presumptiveness was earlier rejected, it nonetheless has redeeming qualities in its recognition of alternative deontological principles, and thus normative pluralism. 22 Yet, it is not as simple as proposing a pluralist theory of contract law which recognises all principles equally. After all, much of the work the judiciary does is balancing between multiple competing rights. 23 One possible solution comes from Saprai, who offers a completely new theory of contract law termed ‘republican contract law’. 24 It thus emphasises the plurality of presumptiveness through a distinctly Dworkinian approach which creates a law that is essentially by the people, and for the people; through incorporating “popular views” regarding morality, limits, and purpose of the law, into the law itself. 25 The theory goes beyond conventionalist theories because it is not merely an “epistemic device” which reflects what the law does, but builds the specific communitarian conception of the law into its deontology – making it the very “fabric of law”. 26 While this open-endedness may lead to uncertainty and indeterminacy of legal standards, such uncertainties are balanced by individuals having a greater understanding of how the law shapes and affects their lives, thereby creating a deeper connection between themselves and the law. 27 Given the ambitious nature of the theory, there is obviously much room to doubt whether it can actually achieve the lofty goals it has set out to accomplish. In fact, flaws can already be seen through an analysis of the theory’s unique conception of freedom as ‘non-domination’. A comprehensive account of what such freedom entails is provided by Pettit, who describes freedom as the characteristic of not being subject to the arbitrary will of others (as opposed to classical freedom as non-interference). 28 The true extent of this freedom is its reach – it goes beyond preventing exercises of arbitrary will and attempts to remove the existence of such arbitrariness completely. 29 Non-domination thus harkens back to the crux of the republican theory – to treat all individuals with equal concern and respect. Saprai states that one particular threat to non-domination is that of dominium, or being subject to the arbitrary will of individuals or individual entities; and that contract law can contribute to the creation of dominium. 30 Despite his claims that a republican theory can prevent dominium, the self-contradictory nature of the theory is already apparent. While Saprai is confident that his theory “shows equal concern and respect” to individuals,31 he seems to forget that any communitarian understanding is made up of both majoritarian and minoritarian components. As a theory that incorporates abstract notions such as morality and justice into the law,32 the theory must necessarily incorporate majoritarian understandings of such abstractions if it is to be practicable and coherent. The framework thus facilitates the inequality, subjugation and control that the theory seeks to eliminate. If it were to attempt to generate a more comprehensive understanding by incorporating minoritarian understandings, it would lose its practicability due to the increase in complexity needed to express a fully comprehensive understanding of societal values – it simply is an impossible task to achieve. Indeed, the plurality which the theory achieves is simply a majoritarian plurality which excludes all other possible values; a plurality that is illusory at best. This article therefore suggests that while the republican theory believes its strength to be its ability to engage greater participation in the shaping and understanding of the law (as mentioned above), its real strength is the value and dignity it accords to individuals. 33 The true value of liberal theories is not the promotion of one particular conception of freedom, but the ability to freely pursue one’s own conception of liberal values (i. e. , self-realised values). 34 Even something as widely respected as autonomy is valuable insofar as it is “exercised in the pursuit of…valuable activities and relationships”. 35 This article therefore proposes that a scoping down of the republican theory into an ‘individualisation’ theory achieves this. Individualisation is simply a theory which recognises that the principle behind contract law is that of promoting and upholding the individual’s right to self-realisation. Historically, individualism has been part of liberal contract theories since the very days of classical freedom of contract, and so it is not an unfamiliar concept to contract law. 36 Moreover, it is the focus on the individual which was the key procedural aspect of Dworkin’s theory. 37 By removing the need to incorporate popular views about morality, rights and other abstractions, and focusing merely on promotion of individual understandings of such concepts, the plurality of values is retained while removing the framework that necessarily promotes instances of abuse and arbitrariness. Two points need to be addressed here. Firstly, one might worry that individualisation would lead to instability – after all, if we recognised all individual conceptions as equal, it would lead to endless conflict and unresolvable disputes. However, it is not us, but arbitrators of the law (i. e. the judiciary) who determine which individual conception would take priority over another, assuming that such conceptions are contradictory. In reality, contracting does not always result in conflicting interpretations, but rather compromise and mutual agreement; it is however, pertinent to address worst-case scenarios and problems with competing interpretations (individualisation is ultimately a pluralist theory at heart). What this means in practice is that the specific individual conception that is accepted by the court will only be valid in the specific circumstance in which it was raised, thus preventing one particular conception from defeating all others. 38 It has little standing nor influence outside of its own unique circumstance, and so each interpretation has limited (but not no) precedential value. 39 On a related note, a second issue arises: if individual conceptions have no ‘longevity’, who would trust the judicial system, and by extension, the legal order? Arguably, trust is ensured because the deontological role of the individual allows all viewpoints to obtain presumptive equality and value until proven otherwise. What this means is not that every person is essentially ‘correct’ until disproven in a court of law, but that all individuals possess the freedom to argue that their specific conception should be accepted by the majority. The trust is therefore placed in the fact that such freedoms will always be upheld in a court of law. Moreover, any arguments arising from conflicting conceptions will be dealt with objectively by the judiciary, thus preventing arbitrary subjection of the ‘losing’ individual (and it shall be shown that the court indeed has adopted such an approach). This follows a late-Rawlsian approach where “individuals are allowed to determine their own conception of the good”40 and where the government and the law remain fairly value-neutral insofar as they do not explicitly incorporate a specific understanding into the legal system. 41 It is this which allows a departure from the ambitiousness of the republican theory, while retaining the pluralist appeal of modern liberalism. 42 Individualisation is thus a hybrid-theory that takes advantage of the republican theory’s focus on freedom, while placing the individual, rather than their collective understandings, as the foundation of contract law. While it lacks certainty in application, such uncertainty can be tolerated given the normative value of the theory. 43 Individualisation in Interpretation: In applying the individualisation theory to the doctrine of contract interpretation, there can be no better case than Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v West Bromwich Building Society46(ICS), and the contextual approach set out by Lord Hoffmann. The approach can be summarised below: Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract. 45 This distinct departure from the textual approach (for example in Arnold v Britton (Arnold)46) has arguably been the most significant development to the doctrine of interpretation in recent time.  ICS should be seen alongside a string of other cases (starting from Prenn v Simmons;47 with the most recent example being Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd48) which fully cemented the position of the contextual approach as the predominant approach towards contract interpretation. The approach taken by Lord Hoffmann contains two limbs, both of which shall be shown to adhere with the individualisation theory: (1) taking into account the “background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties”; (2) the objective meaning of the text. Beginning first with the background knowledge component, the full contours and limits of the contextual approach must be addressed. The relevant cases are that of BCCI v Ali49and Arnold v Britton. In BCCI v Ali, Lord Bingham qualified the contextual approach by saying that it can only be exercised within the limits of the “natural and ordinary meaning” of the contract’s wording. 50 This echoes the words of Lord Neuberger in Arnold, who emphasised the textual limitation of the contextual approach, stating that “commercial common sense and surrounding circumstances […] should not be invoked to undervalue the importance of the language of the provision”. 51 In contrast, Lord Hoffmann chose instead to limit the background knowledge to what the “reasonable man would have regarded as relevant [sic]”. 52 Despite the above cases’ apparent disagreement with ICS, the individualisation theory still reveals itself in both the shift towards the contextual approach, as well as the limitations set on it. This is achieved through two different methods of enhancing individual freedoms. In the shift towards the contextual approach, the understanding and respect of the ‘specific’ individual is enhanced – the Court allowed interpretation to take into account the necessary knowledge needed to situate the individual within his unique circumstance, leading to a deeper level of understanding of that individual’s own conception of liberty. Additionally, the emphasis on the textual limitation, as well as Hoffmann’s ‘reasonable person’ limitation strengthens both the ‘collective’ individual and ‘specific’ individual. Firstly, it sets reasonable limitations to the doctrine of background knowledge – by qualifying the operation of the possibly wide doctrine with the certain existence of the contractual language, the freedom (in the late-Rawlsian sense) of the collective individual is enhanced by preventing arbitrariness. Secondly, it enhances the freedom of the particular parties of the case by limiting interpretation to the exact words they had agreed upon, thus respecting their ‘term freedom’. 53 Subsequently, the objective understanding of the text (as affirmed by Scottish Power UK Plc v BP Exploration Operating Co Ltd54) also complies with the individualisation theory. This is relatively straightforward, and the only aspect that needs to be addressed is the trade-off between enhancing the ‘specific’ or ‘collective’ individual. Given the binary nature of litigation, the objective approach to understanding results in an asymmetric balance between one specific individual’s freedom being narrowed, and one specific individual’s freedom being broadened. However, objectivity as explained above leads to the strengthening of the collective individual – the only question that need be answered then is whether the narrowed freedom of the specific individual can outweigh the enhanced freedom of both the collective, and another specific individual. There can be no definitive answer to this, but it would be reasonable to conclude that consistent application of the objective approach will more likely result in overall enhancement of freedoms, so long as the standard of objectivity is one of reasonableness. Finally, the elephant in the room shall be addressed – that of the exclusion of pre-contractual negotiations in background knowledge. This exclusion was affirmed by Lord Hoffmann himself in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd (Chartbrook)55 where he emphasised the need for certainty and predictability when determining what comprises relevant background knowledge. This is arguably a difficult development to fit within the scope of individualisation. Normatively, pre-contractual negotiations are not more indeterminate than concepts such as “commercial common sense” or what a “reasonable man would have regarded as relevant”. 56 While Lord Hoffmann did identify that allowing pre-contractual negotiations may pose a risk to third-parties, such evidence was inconclusive to warrant a definitive basis for exclusion. 57 Nonetheless, even if such a rule did have the effect of contradicting the individualisation theory, its scope was nonetheless narrowed to only apply within the context of interpretation, and could see possible use in other doctrines of contract law. 58 While this does not fully resolve the problem, Ogilvie contends that doing so would at least weaken the effect of the rule by subsuming it within the principles of interpretation. 59 Thus, the exclusion of pre-contractual negotiations remains as the unaccounted exception to the general application of the individualisation theory. However, given that courts are at least sceptical of its exclusion, there is a possibility that said exclusion may be removed (or at least revisited) in future cases. Concluding Thoughts: Individualisation has been shown to be able to explain the shift from textual to contextual; its further suitability can be seen as even a more nuanced analysis of contract interpretation fits within the theory. Tan argues that the reductionist perspective of distinguishing between textual and contextual should be abandoned for a more iterative  process of “contextual coherence” which can fully account for the “fault lines” which the above approaches are unable to adequately address60 Yet even his suggested theory of interpretation seems to agree with individualisation, as the process does enhance both specific and collective individual freedoms through objective and rational selections of the most “coherent” text from multiple competing interpretations. 61) Consequently, individualisation does present itself as an attractive and, most importantly, reasonable principle behind the development of contract interpretation. The only problem faced by the theory is difficulties in proving its foundational aspect; all the evidence that has been presented merely demonstrates that the case law fits within the scope of the theory, thus fulfilling the conventionalist aspect. To confirm the deontological aspect of the theory will require an explicit mention by the judiciary that individualisation has been its guiding principle. Unfortunately, no amount of analysis will bring us to such an answer.

    "title": "Jogee and ‘West Side Story’- Still Unresolved Endings? ",
    "body": "2021/05/28 - Abstract: Have you ever wondered how ‘West Side Story’ might have been resolved in the English courts? In such cases of gang violence, the area of complicity governs the typical situation where the accused (the ‘Accessory’) did not commit the crime but assisted or encouraged the principal offender to do so. This note analyses the impact of R v Jogee, arguably the most seminal case in this area of law,by tracing the legal and social aftermath of the decision. It begins by questioning how Jogee was initially lauded for its reversion back to principle, and the extent to which it truly righted a ‘wrong turn’ in the law by navigating the academic literature on the disputed issue of intention in the Jogee judgement. In discussing the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the current law on accomplice liability, this note ultimately still finds the law wanting of necessary clarifications. Moreover, a holistic approach to reform is required, including ensuring the integrity of prosecution charging decisions by removing the inaccurate racialised gang narrative permeating this area of law. This work was inspired by LSE’s Criminal Law syllabus on the topic of Complicity. I declare that it has not been submitted elsewhere. Introduction 1: Pre-Jogee,2 a defendant’s accessorial liability could be established via two avenues. First, under section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, where one could be charged with ‘ordinary’ accessorial liability by ‘aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring’ the principal’s offence. Second, via Parasitic Accessorial Liability (‘PAL’), an ‘extended’ form of joint enterprise liability (established in Chan Wing-Siu). 3 If two parties undertook a joint enterprise to commit a crime whereby the principal committed a further offence, the secondary would be guilty as an accessory to that further crime (incurring liability ‘parasitic’ on the principal’s crime), if s/he foresaw that the principal would act as s/he did. Jogee purportedly abolished this second route, limiting the basis of criminalising secondary participation to basic accessorial liability. Jogee involved joint appeals for murder convictions where victims were killed by the principals’ use of a knife. However, the prosecution procured convictions by arguing that the defendants had engaged in a joint enterprise to commit the act which caused the victim’s death. In Mr Jogee’s case, he and Mr Hirsi became increasingly intoxicated whilst together. Later, they visited Mr Fyfe’s residence where they had heated exchanges with Mr Fyfe. Mr Fyfe was subsequently stabbed to death by Mr Hirsi. Mr Jogee had been outside striking a car with a bottle and shouting encouragement at Mr Hirsi to do something to Mr Fyfe. Both men ran off after the stabbing. 4 Mr Jogee was convicted on the basis that he foresaw the principal might intentionally cause grievous bodily harm or murder if the circumstances arose. The Supreme Court overturned the conviction and effected a change to the mens rea requirement, requiring him to have known or intended that Mr Hirsi would have intentionally caused grievous harm if the circumstances arose. 5 Thus, Jogee’s abolition of the PAL doctrine reflects a swing of the judicial pendulum from a crime-control model based on public policy reasons, back to a due-process model grounded on principled reasons (pre-existing Powell). 6 For our purposes, the most salient traits of the due-process model embody the ‘minimal assumption’ that the defendant is innocent until an impartial adversarial trial process. The crime-control model prioritises repression of any criminal conduct and regards preliminary screening by the police and prosecution as ‘adequate guarantees of reliable factfinding’. 7 In theory, while Jogee limits the scope of joint enterprise and brings the jurisprudence of joint enterprise back to principled grounds, it does not necessarily eradicate the operation of PAL. In practice, the highly restrictive judicial approach to appeals that has developed since Jogee, and discriminatory prosecutorial framework based upon a racialised gang narrative present additional challenges to the ‘ground-breaking’ status Jogee was lauded for when it was decided five years ago. It is worth mentioning from the outset that joint enterprise is a heavily politicised doctrine, which provided prosecutors with a brutal but effective mode of crackdown on homicide cases. Hence, clarity is needed to prevent undue side effects of the judgement from materialising, and a wider approach to reform is also required to adequately deal with the doctrine’s social impact. Theoretical Analysis: Jogee abolished the doctrine of PAL, with the central aspect of change involving the fault element required in PAL. It raised the mens rea threshold for the secondary party from foreseeing (established in Chan Wing Siu) to intending to assist or encourage the principal’s actus reus and mens rea in committing the crime (per Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1975). 8 Past policy significance of PAL: Simester’s moral forfeiture theory of liability provides a justification in principle for joint enterprise,9 whereby a group constituted by joint enterprise has set itself against the law and society at large. However, given the doctrine’s expansiveness, it is realistically more likely motivated bypolicy concerns of exercising deterrence and public protection. As Lord Steyn in Powell 10 points out, the accessory principle is ‘needed and cannot be abolished or relaxed’ because of the ‘social problem’ that ‘criminal enterprises’ often ‘escalate into the commission of greater offences’. 11 This understanding aligns with the psychological ‘risky shift phenomenon’, whereby an individual’s estimation of risk is skewed when acting as part of a group and may act in a more extreme manner. 12 The House of Lords in Chan Wing-Siu seemed to conceive PAL as essential to prevent an accomplice from evading the consequences of a criminal enterprise, seemingly taking any occasional injustices in its stride as ‘necessary evil’. The stakes are high given that in England and Wales, the accomplice is punished for the same offence as the principal. In effect, it was possible to sentence the accomplice to life imprisonment as long as s/he was reckless to the commission of murder, despite not having intended murder to be committed. The disparity of treatment between the principal and accomplice was particularly problematic for homicide, which has a mandatory life imprisonment sentence. This created a legal limbo between convicting the accomplice for the full offence of murder or letting them go scot free although they may not have been fully innocent. Neither options in this binary system proportionately label the accessory’s liability nor provide the flexibility to charge them according to their degree of involvement. The developing backdrop of policy reasons has not only caused PAL to incriminate disproportionately but also caused confusion for accessory liability generally. Gnango 13 has exemplified the confusion over joint enterprise, where the victim was caught in crossfire between two gunmen on the way home. Finding that two characters with diametrically opposed intents were engaged in a joint enterprise undermined the assumption that parties in a joint enterprise would be acting in concert. This legal fiction imputed foresight where it was non-existent, equating it to intention, thus revealing a blatant policy-driven approach where joint enterprise principles have been twisted and stretched to establish full liability for murder. As Virgo argues, the judgements of Lords Clarke, Brown and Dyson allowed the significance of the relevance of a joint enterprise to overwhelm the need to prove actus reus and mens rea by ‘completely ignoring’ the two fundamental principles. 14This evinces the degree of prevalent confusion that is the ‘characteristic weaknesses’ of a doctrine that was allowed to develop in a ‘pragmatic and unprincipled’ manner. 15 Restoration of Principle: Thus, Jogee arguably brings accessorial liability back to principled grounds, righting a ‘wrong turn’ of ‘questionable policy arguments’. 16 The PAL doctrine in Chan Wing-Siu had shifted the focus of the mens rea requirement onto the accessory’s foresight on what the principal might do, rather than on his intention of how the principal should act, drastically lowering the threshold for convicting defendants involved in a joint criminal venture. The bar is further lowered in cases where it is unclear whether the defendant is the principal or the accessory; as Gianetto 17 shows, the prosecution need only prove that the defendant possessed the requisite mens rea and contributed to the end result to be held fully responsible for the crime. In Jogee, the Supreme Court clarified that foresight is no more than ‘evidence’ for the requisite intention; while intention may be ‘conditional’, the jury must be sure that a defendant on trial as a secondary had intended the criminal outcome. This upholds several cardinal principles within the criminal law, including the principles of responsibility 18 that one should only be held responsible for his intended acts, as well as proportionality and fair labelling in sentencing. Pre-Jogee, the judge was obliged to sentence convicted secondary participants to mandatory life imprisonment, although they might have been convicted on mere foresight. 19 The situation reeks of injustice with the blatant lack of discretion to mitigate the sentence according to the defendant’s level of involvement. As Wilson and Ormerod argue, if the law wishes to hold a defendant liable for reckless foresight and the ‘danger his own acts excite’,20 the appropriate charge is one of manslaughter (the substituted crime Jogee was sentenced for), but not murder. This has been explicitly confirmed in paragraph 96 of Jogee. 21 Now, the possibility of a substitute manslaughter conviction allows for the judge to vary the sentence proportionate to individual culpability. However, the assertion that complicity has been restricted through the elimination of PAL may not be entirely valid given the blurry intention/foresight distinction and the shifted focus on to conditional intent in Jogee. Residual Unclarity = Backdoor for PAL?: Although the court recognised that foresight was ‘good evidence’ of intention and that the two were ‘not synonymous’, Jogee is crucially silent on what threshold of foresight from the defendant might enable a jury to infer requisite intent. This could lead to juries readily inferring intent from some ‘middling’ degree of foresight,22 effectively neutralising Jogee’s effect on complicity. Moreover, the courts left open the question as to whether oblique intention in secondary liability was to be treated similarly as in the law of murder, notably without addressing Woollin where a high threshold of foresight (‘virtual certainty’) is considered sufficient intention. Jogee’s ambivalence may allow the jury to infer an accessory’s intent to murder based on foresight alone, including a lower level than virtual certainty. Krebs highlights that ‘as long as Woollin remains good law’, Jogee cannot achieve its aim of restoring parity of culpability between the principal and accessory. 23 However ‘virtually certain’ an accessory may be of a principal’s plans, this remains ‘a far cry from the certainty of future causal developments described in Woollin‘24: This presumed application of Woollin in accessorial liability cases is also problematic in two senses: First, Woollin is epistemically problematic in the joint enterprise situation where multiple actors are involved. Liability is essentially determined on another free human being acting conditionally. Secondly, even where the accessory has the requisite conditional intent, ‘any number of things might transpire to deter’25 the principal from killing. Given the accessory has no bearing on both of these issues, this reinforces how the accessory’s agency over culpability for their own actions remains lacking due to unclarity as to how other doctrines might apply. Jogee also recognises that the accessory’s conditional intent will be sufficient mens rea. The enlargement of the role of conditional intent may be restrictive for collateral which is less likely to be attributable to complicity parties due to an evidential lack of prior planning. However, Ashworth highlights how the retention of conditional intent allows the jury to infer intention and ‘tacit agreement’ through foresight in effect, if s/he foresaw that the principal might decide to intentionally inflict that level of harm. 26 This bears ‘striking resemblance’ to parasitic accessorial liability as Smith has noted. 27 Perhaps, this gives credence to Stark’s observation that Chan Wing-Siu was not a wrong turning of the law as Jogee portrayed, but an honest recognition of what the law is, citing a ‘wider principle’ beyond the standard assisting and encouraging whereby the accessory is criminally liable for the principal’s acts ‘of a type which [s/he] foresees but does not necessarily intend’. 28 Hence it seems that PAL has not been abolished but rather ‘tamed’,29 perhaps operating more covertly as recognised by the Hong Kong case Chan Kam-Shing 30 where the formulation of conditional intent in Anwar 31 (‘if the circumstances arise’) was taken to be suggestive that English law was drifting back to joint criminal enterprise. On this basis, Jogee’s restriction of the complicity’s scope seems ‘less than might have been appreciated’32 as it is formal rather than substantive. 33 Is Residual Unclarity Entirely Undesirable?: While Jogee signals an intention to return to more principled grounds, more clarity on the requisite threshold of foresight is necessary to ensure legal consistency and certainty, all the more imperative given the heavy charges and high stakes involved. Ashworth has argued against any leeway on the requisite degree of foresight to infer intention, contending that the courts should aim to introduce a tighter definition of intention for such a serious offence and deal with more complicated cases using defences or partial defences. 34 However, this argument assumes that Jogee was trying to substantively define intention in the first place. One might question if it is even possible for the Supreme Court to provide a threshold that would provide clear guidance in the multiplicity of joint enterprise cases, without being a mere empty label. It is easier to make a negative statement that foresight was not intention, but harder to provide positive guidance for the threshold of foresight that would amount to intention. Moreover, it is notable that the concept of foresight being taken as evidence for intention was not birthed from Jogee, but appears in virtually every single case. When framing charges, the prosecution works to convince the jury to draw the necessary inference of intention from foresight. As expressed by Lord Bridge in Moloney, ‘[foreseeability] belongs, not to the substantive law, but to the law of evidence’. 35 While Ormerod and Laird have rightly criticised the ambiguity of the new mens rea requirement,36 it might be argued ambiguity is not necessarily wholly undesirable. Rather, it may mean flexibility allowing for the law to cater to a range of defendant profiles. Instead of providing a backdoor for the old law to creep in, it might be perceived as a tool allowing the jury to convict where the defendant is highly culpable, similar to the retention of jury ‘moral elbow room’ as in Woollin,37 a term coined by Horder referring to the jury’s discretion on whether the crime fits the defendant’s conduct. 38 One’s view of the legal inbuilt flexibility left in Jogee’s wake may to a certain extent turn on one’s trust in the exercise of discretion by the judge and jury. It also allows the accessory a chance to argue that while s/he might have had some level of foresight, it did not amount to intention. Comparatively, the previous approach meant that any foresight made a conviction virtually certain. Overall, the extent to which complicity has been restricted in practice is questionable. Given the Supreme Court’s vague treatment of the actus reus requirement of joint enterprise as a ‘common unlawful purpose’, the fundamental effectiveness of Jogee’s purported abolition of PAL is debatable. Hence, Virgo’s perspective of the implicit existence of PAL as a ‘backdoor’ is arguably more convincing than Simester’s view that PAL has been successfully abolished by Jogee’s return to principle. Observations in Practice: Moreover, the theoretical potential for PAL to creep back into the law is an even more realistic practical concern when contextualised in the reality of discriminatory prosecutorial practices, coupled with low prospect of successful appeals. High threshold for appeals: Ormerod and Laird have postulated that the Supreme Court may have intended for conditional intent to apply only in limited circumstances. 39 However, Dyson points out that in practice, a defendant convicted under PAL may still be liable through having conditional intent that the principal will commit the crime. 40 This was starkly demonstrated in R v Johnson and Others, 41where the Court of Appeal faced a range of appeals contending wrongful convictions under the old law. Yet, it appeared surprisingly easy to establish that accomplices liable for PAL would now be convicted of murder based on conditional intent. 42 The court appeared confident that in all cases, the appellants had the ‘necessary conditional intent’ that the weapon be used with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. To bring an appeal against a conviction ‘out of time’ (lodged over 28 days post-conviction), an applicant needs ‘exceptional leave’,43 and this will only be granted if the applicant can demonstrate having suffered ‘a substantial injustice’ due to the change in the law. The Court of Appeal made clear that they were not interested in investigating whether the change might have made a difference to the verdict, or whether the applicant suffered adverse consequences from conviction, such as stigmatisation. 44 The court admitted this was ‘a high threshold’45 but it has proven relatively insurmountable. To date, only one case (R v Crilly 46) has successfully appealed under Jogee,47 and the Court of Appeal was clear to present a ‘faithful’48 adherence to the restrictive approach in Johnson. The focus is not on jury misdirection but the basis of prosecution itself - in Crilly, the prosecution’s case was evidently ‘to all intents and purposes a case about his foresight’,49 as opposed to intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Unchanged framework of discriminatory prosecutorial practices and institutionalised racism: Yet, even for the rare successful appeal applicants and defendants post-Jogee, there is little relief in practice. Consideration of the law post-Jogee has shown disappointing realisation of the regressive potential of Jogee’s uncertainties. Socially, PAL critics were less preoccupied with the unprincipled elision of mens rea levels but more concerned with the extensive, disproportionate and discriminatory incrimination. The Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge found that joint enterprise convictions lead to three times as many black men serving life sentences than those in the general prison population. 50 Birkbeck’s Prison Reform Trust study found that two-thirds of their sample belonged to a minority ethnic group, and over 40% were black. 51 Similar trends can be found in the age of joint enterprise convicts, slanting heavily toward 18-24 year olds with a surprising number of under-18 convictions as well. Underlying PAL’s propensity for the conviction of young minorities is a narrative rooted in the justification for joint enterprise itself. 52 The oft-peddled explanation for the need of such an expansive tool of incrimination is the difficulty of prosecuting gang crimes - the confusion of who did what and who said what creates intensive prosecutorial difficulties to illustrate to the jury the role each defendant played in the overall crime. During the rampant public disorders of the 1980s, the police were given enhanced stop and search powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 (also the year Chan Wing-Siu was decided). The reputational expansiveness of joint criminal enterprise led its acronym ‘JCE’ to be referred to as ‘Just Convict Everyone’. 53 Furthermore, ‘suspect populations’ were identified to have greater propensity to engage in organised crime, discriminatorily targeting ethnic minority communities and controversially conflating the ‘criminal gang’ with ‘Black youths’ in media and political discourse. 54 Joint Enterprise is therefore a political tool for simplification of both the prosecution and jury’s task. The Crown Prosecution Service’s own direction on the relevance of ‘gang’ references explains its utility as an evidentiary basis for a chain of inferences. 55 Association with a gang can lead to an inference of knowledge of the gang’s predisposition for violence, which can lead to an inference of the requisite mens rea. 56 Jogee does not change all this. Although the requisite mens rea is changed from foresight to intention, the jury is free to infer intention from foresight. Jogee merely adds another link in the chain of inference starting from gang association to conviction. It would be ‘misguided’57 to assume that the prosecuting parties would not continue making the same extended inferences from gang associations. With the pressing doctrinal questions that Jogee leaves unresolved, the same issues with joint enterprise may well continue to be systemically perpetuated. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has adduced evidence demonstrating that convictions are being secured in our courts without sufficient evidence to convict, especially in cases where there are more defendants when the CPS is ‘more likely to offer no evidence’ for at least some defendants. 58 Jogee’s framework does not prohibit this. This is particularly problematic in light of the questionable relationship between joint enterprise and the racialised gang narrative. The problem is that ‘gang’ narratives seem to be part and parcel of some joint enterprise prosecutions regardless of whether the label fits. The CPS is adamant that ‘gang’ references must be ‘cautious[ly]’ made and only invoked with a proper ‘evidential basis’, but it seems like the bar for what counts as ‘evidence’ can be grossly low. 59 The widely reported ‘Moss Side’ murder case provides a clear demonstration of Jogee’s equivocal aspects. Eleven defendants aged 14-20, all ethnic minorities, were convicted on the basis of joint enterprise liability in R v Goodall. 60 During the trial, the prosecution explained that when the defendants chased and beat the victim, culminating in one of the defendants delivering a fatal stab, it was a co-ordinated gang attack on a member of a rival gang. 61 In terms of evidence, the Crown claimed the defendants had ‘self-admissions’ of gang memberships. 62 Yet, the calibre of evidence presented to evince gang affiliations was apparently the fact that some of the defendants did hand signs in their Instagram pictures, which the prosecution argued amounted to admission of gang affiliations. 63 Those for whom such condemnatory evidence was not found, had their association proven on the basis of their friendships with those who had. 64 The presence of a ‘gang’ provided a prosecutorial framework to construct a hindsight narrative of the facts, presenting a situation that reportedly sporadically developed as organised crime. The empirical evidence for this is faltering. Hallsworth’s behavioural research shows that on the streets, gang structures are ‘radically informal and non-hierarchical’ and organisational plans are ‘situationally determined and driven’ rather than premeditated. 65 The ‘gang’ discourse therefore problematically permeates prosecutorial tendencies, since the evidence does not meet Feinberg’s threshold of ‘a very high degree of antecedent group solidarity’66 to render this framework morally acceptable. Moreover, the inbuilt biases of the racialised gang narrative further compromise on the integrity of the policing process. Amnesty International’s recent report has highlighted the Gangs Matrix database used by the Metropolitan Police as racially stigmatising and the ‘wrong tool for the wrong problem’. 67 Recognising that gang associations are based on dubious evidential grounds, the statistic that almost 80% of ethnic-minority joint enterprise prisoners were labelled gang members compared to 38. 5% of white prisoners is condemnatory and discriminatory. 68 When the basis of a defendant’s gang association is suspect, it is difficult not to be critical of the fact that joint enterprise post-Jogee still allows the prosecution to draw and the jury to follow a chain of inferences that leads rather conveniently down a slippery slope from ‘possible gang member’ to ‘guilty’. In this respect, the jury’s discretion left in Jogee compounded by prosecutorial discretion in the law enforcement system may not have addressed a problematic status quo of institutional racism at all but perpetuated it. Conclusion: Theoretically, Jogee on paper is a much-needed reversion back to principle, allowing for fair labelling of criminals by raising the mens rea requirement to reflect their culpability more accurately. However, many potential issues remain unclarified, notably whether it truly does change the law or simply allow the old law to operate beneath indeterminate wording. Coupled with the practical context that access to appeals is heavily restricted and the inbuilt biases in the prosecution procedures, it is submitted that until these elements are rectified, we remain yoked to the underlying vestiges of the crime-control model. The Supreme Court may have held that PAL was a ‘wrong turn’ in the law, yet a real reversion to a due-process model to achieve truly criminally just outcomes in the law of Joint Enterprise would require holistic reform: to internally develop and clarify the substantive law, and externally regulate and eliminate biases from the prosecutorial framework.

    "body": "2021/04/17 - Introduction: In Elgizouli v Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Supreme Court considered whether it was unlawful for the Secretary of State to authorise mutual legal assistance (“MLA”) to the United States in order to assist a criminal investigation which could lead to the imposition of the death penalty on a suspected British terrorist. 1 This article first sets out the factual background and context of this case. It will then go on to examine the Court’s reasoning, particularly on the legality of the Secretary of State’s actions on the basis of common law principles. The article will situate Elgizouli within existing jurisprudence on common law constitutional rights. In doing so, it will argue that the Court has revealed a more restrictive approach to such rights. Finally, this article will discuss how Elgizouli demonstrates that the scope of common law constitutional rights seems to be limited to procedural rights (as opposed to substantive rights). Background of Elgizouli: In Elgizouli, the applicant’s son was suspected of involvement in a terrorist group which committed serious crimes, including the beheading of 27 men in Syria. 2 In 2015, the US requested MLA – which enables the US and UK governments to share information for the purposes of criminal proceedings – with respect to an investigation into that terrorist group. 3 While the Home Secretary requested the US guarantee that information provided would not be used in a prosecution that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty, the US did not provide such an assurance. Despite the lack of this assurance from the US, the Home Secretary agreed to the MLA request and supplied relevant information to US authorities. 4 While witness statements had already been transferred to US authorities before the case was brought to the courts, the Supreme Court nonetheless emphasised the importance of determining the legality of the Home Secretary’s actions as “[f]urther material may be sought” 5 by US authorities. At first instance, it was held in the Divisional Court that the Home Secretary’s actions were neither unlawful under the common law nor the provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”). 6 However, the Divisional Court certified two questions of law of public importance: (i) whether the Home Secretary’s exercise of power to provide MLA which will facilitate the imposition of the death penalty was unlawful under the common law; and (ii) whether the Home Secretary’s exercise of power was unlawful under the provisions of the DPA 2018. 7 This article will focus on the Supreme Court’s reasoning as to whether the Secretary of State’s actions were unlawful under the common law. The Supreme Court’s reasoningThe majority held that there was no common law principle which prevented the sharing of information in an MLA request which might lead to the imposition of the death penalty. Lord Kerr was the sole dissenter on this issue and held that the common law ought to recognise that it should be unlawful to facilitate investigations by providing material which might lead to the imposition of the death penalty in a foreign country. 8 Of importance is the Justices’ reasoning on the scope of common law constitutional rights and how the common law should (or should not) develop to accommodate new rights. Giving one of the two substantive judgments of the majority, Lord Carnwath pointed out that “the death penalty […] has never attracted the attention of the common law” with recent developments coming from Parliament or the European Court of Human Rights. 9 Consequently, the common law must develop “in line with the European Convention, but not beyond”. 10 More crucially, as this was a case involving the facilitation of the death penalty by the transfer of information, “the development of a common law rule would have to take account of the fact that […] Parliament has recently legislated in this field, in the 2018 Act”. 11 Given the highly detailed nature of data transfer rules under the DPA 2018, a common law prohibition of transfer of information in certain circumstances could not be reconciled with the statutory data protection regime. 12 Lord Carnwath thus evinced a limited scope for the development of common law constitutional rights, with such rights inextricably bound up with pre-existing Convention rights and legislative frameworks. Beyond affirming Lord Carnwath’s reasons, Lord Reed (with whom Lady Black and Lord Llyod-Jones agreed) further argued that the development of the common law must build “incrementally on existing principles”. 13 In the first place, incremental development preserves “legal certainty” by ensuring that any changes to the common law are undertaken based on “established principles”. 14 Furthermore, parliamentary sovereignty means that the courts should be cautious when developing the common law especially with the “procedural and institutional limitations which restrict the ability of litigation before the courts to act as an engine of law reform”. 15 Against this broader principle, Lord Reed was of the opinion that the common law was not capable of supplying a right prohibiting MLA which could potentially lead to the death penalty because such a right would not be “an incremental step”. 16 Drawing on constitutional and legal policy justifications, Lord Reed similarly envisioned a more restrictive role for the courts in the development of new rights under the common law. On the other hand, Lord Kerr adopted a different approach to common law constitutional rights. Upon examining different sources of constitutional rights, Lord Kerr argued that recognising a right against the provision of information in an MLA request that could lead to the imposition of the death penalty was a “natural and inevitable extension” of the current prohibition of extradition without death penalty assurances. 17 In particular, Lord Kerr emphasised that the common law should adapt to afford human rights protection in novel cases; Convention rights merely “represent a threshold protection” and cannot act as “an inhibitor to the development of the common law” in human rights jurisprudence. 18 Lord Kerr thus took a more liberal approach to common law constitutional rights, with the common law being capable of independently evolving to supply human rights protection. As Fairclough notes, Elgizouli is significant because it lays out key areas of dispute in common law constitutional rights – both relating to “the relationship between the common law and the HRA” as well as “the extent to which common-law rights can develop”. 19 While Lords Carnwath and Reed arguably conceptualised a more deferential role for common law constitutional rights (both in its relationship to the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”) and the development of new principles), Lord Kerr posited that the common law could dynamically develop outside the boundaries of Convention rights. Analysis: To contextualise the significance of Elgizouli, it is important to understand the developing jurisprudence on common law constitutional rights. In recent years, the courts have seemingly engendered a new approach to common law constitutional rights. In particular, the judges have stressed the vigour of the common law in supplying human rights protection. Such an approach was particularly evident in Osborn v Parole Board, where the Supreme Court stated that the HRA “does not supersede the protection of human rights under the common law or statute, or create a discrete body of law based upon the judgements of the European court”. 20 Instead, the courts should develop constitutional rights in parallel to the HRA. As Elliott notes, Osborn was remarkable in that it “places common-law rights centre-stage, [with] consideration of the ECHR being treated as a secondary matter”. 21 The possibility for common law constitutional rights to take precedence over and even supply stronger protection than the HRA was demonstrated in two subsequent cases. In Kennedy v The Charity Commission, the claimant argued that Article 10 of the Convention included a right to receive information from public authorities. Rejecting this argument, the Court went on to hold that there was a “common law presumption in favour of openness”22 and that a right to receive information from public authorities could possibly be supplied by the common law. Subsequently, in A v BBC, the Court emphasised that the “common law principle of open justice remains in vigour, even when Convention rights are also applicable”. 23 As such, this trilogy of cases suggests that the courts have been willing to develop a richer catalogue of common law constitutional rights and that the common law could itself act as a robust defender of human rights. At first blush, the majority’s reasoning in Elgizouli evinces a much stricter approach to common law constitutional rights and seems to contradict the Court’s liberal approach in the trilogy of cases just discussed. In Osborn, Kennedy and BBC, common law constitutional rights occupied a central position and could even take precedence over the HRA. Yet, common law constitutional rights took a backseat in Elgizouli. In Elgizouli, Lords Reed and Carnwath stated that common law constitutional rights must cautiously and incrementally develop, curtailing the capacity of the common law to evolve and provide stronger human rights protection. The question, then, is whether these positions can be reconciled; or if they cannot, perhaps it might be said that Elgizouli represents the advent of a stricter approach to common law constitutional rights. On closer analysis, what Elgizouli reveals is that the ambit of common law rights protection has always been relatively limited in scope. In Kennedy and BBC, the right in question was a right to open justice. As Elliott argues, the Court may be particularly willing to enforce certain rights where they are “a reflection of a constitutional principle to which especial curial weight is attached”. 24 This could explain why a right to open justice was particularly prized by the Court in Kennedy and BBC, as the notion of open justice is tied to rule of law considerations such as transparency and accountability. 25 As such, while the common law might be generous with applying certain kinds of rights which are firmly grounded in well-established constitutional principles (such as a right to open justice), they are more reticent when it comes to recognising new types of rights (such as a right against non-facilitation of the death penalty). On this reasoning, Elgizouli sheds light on the limited normative reach of common law constitutional rights as well as the common law’s selectivity in its protection of human rights. While it might be too early to draw a conclusion on the precise scope of common law constitutional rights, it could be argued that the common law is more willing to enforce procedural rights as opposed to substantive rights, especially when those rights are linked to fundamental constitutional principles such as the rule of law. This reading of Elgizouli might be supported by the judgement of the Supreme Court in Moohan v Lord Advocate. In Moohan, the Court considered the legality of the Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 which banned prisoners from voting in the referendum. 26 Of note is the Court’s discussion of the common law position on the right to vote, which is a substantive rather than procedural right. Lord Hodge stated that the common law has not developed to “recognise a right of universal and equal suffrage from which any derogation must be provided for by law and must be proportionate”. 27 In so holding, Lord Hodge observed that the right to vote has always been a statutory creation and that it would thus be constitutionally inappropriate for the common law to “override the statutory rules which determine our democratic franchise”. 28 The Court’s reticence to recognise a right to vote at common law in Moohan aligns with the Court’s reluctance to extend the protection of the common law to the prohibition of supplying information in an MLA which might lead to the death penalty in Elgizouli. Ultimately, as Elliot argues, it seems that “only a subset of common law rights […] form an irreducible nucleus that may be resistant in the face of implacably incompatible primary legislation”. 29 Where does this leave us? While Elgizouli does not bring us closer to drawing up a specific catalogue of rights which exist at the common law, it reminds us that common law constitutional rights are ultimately limited in breadth. While the common law might be a rigorous form of human rights protection when it comes to certain types of rights, other forms of rights are delimited from its scope. In particular, the majority in Elgizouli seems to have adopted an especially narrow conception of common law rights, with the development of such rights being constrained by statutory law and pre-existing rights enshrined in the common law. In this regard, there is a strong argument in favour of Lord Kerr’s approach, as he posits that the courts should extend common law principles to supply human rights protection in novel cases. This ties in with Fairclough’s argument that the common law should move towards a more principled approach to the identification of common law constitutional rights – by recognising that common law constitutional rights are normatively underpinned by the rule of law, this opens up the space for more rights to be protected by the common law insofar as they are underpinned by rule of law considerations. 30 Conclusion: Ultimately, while the current scope of common law constitutional rights appears limited, we may not need to be overly concerned as things currently stand. This is because the HRA can be seen as a sufficiently rigorous way of ensuring that human rights are protected in the UK. This is especially so considering that the courts have a far-reaching interpretative duty under Section 3(1) of the HRA to give effect to Convention rights. In particular, the courts have been willing to “depart from the unambiguous meaning of the legislation” to achieve an interpretation that is consistent with the protection of human rights. 31 As such, it could be argued that, where the common law is currently lacking, the HRA fills the lacuna. Elgizouli confirms that the courts are selective when it comes to the breadth of common law constitutional rights. While the picture of human rights protection is not necessarily bleak due to the HRA, we might be more concerned if the HRA faces repeal in the future. It should be noted that the government launched an independent review of the HRA (led by Sir Peter Gross) in December 2020, focusing on the “structural framework” of the HRA instead of the substantive rights encapsulated in the HRA. 32 While it seems unlikely that the HRA will be repealed in the near future, it remains to be seen how the outcome of the independent review might alter the current working of the HRA. In this sense, Elgizouli serves as a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring that the HRA has the capacity to effectively protect human rights, as common law constitutional rights are unable to offer the same rigour of protection as the HRA.

    "title": "Rethinking the concept of the Rule of Law in Modern Britain",
    "body": "2021/04/16 - INTRODUCTION: Western countries take pride in their orderly constitutional systems which reflect their aspirations to respect human rights and the rule of law (“RoL”). However, when considering the actual meaning and intended genuine effect of the RoL, the concept actually generates more confusion than its inconclusive terminology suggests. Situating the concept of the RoL in the British constitutional system and identifying its role in the exercise of law-making reveals unexpected complications. Recent events, such as Brexit negotiations and the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for the exploration of the true meaning of the RoL in modern Britain and evaluating its role in the British constitution. Last year, Parliament enacted the Coronavirus Act 2020, in which it granted the Government extensive discretionary powers through delegated legislation. 1 Later in the year, the Government proposed clauses in the Internal Market Bill that would directly breach international law. 2 Even though the events clearly had major implications for the RoL, the Government and Parliament were still allowed to proceed with their agenda. The events demonstrate the elusiveness of the RoL and how easily the concept is disregarded. But why has the constitutional order, purportedly based on the RoL, not disintegrated and collapsed? The answer to this question might lie in the fact that the RoL does not hold any tangible value because of its conceptual uncertainty. The concept is correctly encapsulated by Tamanaha, who noted that “everyone is for [the RoL], but have contrasting convictions about what it is”. 3 This article will argue that the RoL exists only as a descriptive concept of the modern constitution, without a clear definition in both procedural accounts (arguing that the RoL covers only the form of law and its procedures) and substantive accounts (arguing that in addition to its procedural component, the RoL should also require compliance with the substance of the law and human rights). This makes it open to attacks and incapable of being justified by strong argumentation in the legal context. The article will proceed with discussing the incompatibility of a prescriptive RoL with the British constitutional system, particularly with the central principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Moreover, it will explore the role of the RoL in Britain’s political structure and raise concerns about the potential for abuse in this context. The article will conclude with proposals about the future of the RoL. THE RULE OF LAW REASSESSED: The predicament of defining the rule of law : British jurists have attempted to define the RoL for more than a century. The most comprehensive explanation of the RoL was provided by Lord Bingham, who listed both procedural and substantive ˝sub-rules˝ that constituted the RoL. 4 However, Lord Bingham himself recognised that statutory law does not define the RoL – with the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 being the only statute that mentions the RoL. The Act’s Section 1(a) states: “The Act does not adversely affect the existing constitutional principle of the rule of law”. 5 According to Bingham, the authors of the 2005 Act found the task of defining the RoL too complex and therefore left it to the judiciary. 6 Therefore, the principle is referred to in an Act of Parliament without any comprehensive definition. Arguing before the court that this constitutional principle has been infringed would be extremely onerous. In any event, it goes against the principle of legal certainty. 7 Even though it remains a legal principle, paradoxically, it also goes against Bingham’s own elaboration on the RoL, presenting the requirement of laws being clear, predictable and questions of legal rights being resolved by application of law and not the exercise of discretion. 8 The principle’s presence in an Act of Parliament would undoubtedly require more certainty as to its meaning than other non-codified principles. Dicey’s Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution also shed light on the issues of defining the RoL by drawing both from procedural and substantive accounts. Dicey emphasised that the RoL is an inherent feature of English institutions, as opposed to other European countries, e. g. , France. 9 He stressed three elements that make the English legal system the perfect manifestation of the RoL. Firstly, he claimed that no citizen will be punished except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before ordinary Courts of the land. 10 Secondly, Dicey reiterated the value of equality under the common law. 11 Thirdly, he stressed that the English constitution’s protection of personal liberties is a result of “judicial decisions on rights of private persons” and not a result of some general principles in foreign constitutions. 12 There are two aspects of this interpretation worth mentioning: firstly, using judicial decisions and common law as primary proof for the RoL is perhaps not the most convincing argument. It is difficult to establish that judges were guided by the RoL in decision-making while authors of other constitutions were not. Even though judges decide cases in line with procedural requirements, it is still their interpretation of fact and law. Their decisions in many cases, with the lack of common law and statutory basis, tend to be discretionary. Moreover, Supreme Court Justices, despite being bound by the stare decisis doctrine, can evidently still change previously decided law if there are strong grounds for that decision. 13 Secondly, Dicey’s account clearly demonstrates that the RoL is a descriptive rather than prescriptive concept. The constitutional system contains certain elements that, when analysed jointly, encapsulate the RoL – however, rather than the concept acting as a norm or rule that the state ought to comply with, the rule of law instead describes law-making in Britain. While Dicey showed that the RoL was present in the British constitution, Britain itself did not aspire to achieve this ideal, but rather created the system and institutions which turned out to contain characteristics and an inherent value of what Dicey saw as the RoL. In the words of Finnis, Dicey’s RoL is merely “the name commonly given to the state of affairs in which a legal system is legally in good shape”. 14 That is why it would be hard to say that the RoL is a British achievement as it would be impossible to prove that the concept was the absolute objective of British judges as proposed by Dicey. It is what simultaneously arose with the creation of the British legal system and did not precede its creation. The descriptive nature of the RoL can also be traced in the procedural account of another legal philosopher, Joseph Raz, who recognised conformity to the RoL as an inherent (but non-prescriptive) value in law-making and a result of an instrumental conception of law. 15 Raz created his own list of principles best explaining the RoL, and particularly emphasised the notions of certainty and prospectivity of laws. 16 Evincing a procedural account, Raz associated the RoL with the protection of individuals’ freedom to plan their lives, in the spirit of Hayekian philosophy. 17 Raz suggested that the RoL minimises (or attempts to minimise) the danger of infringing people’s freedom by requiring clear and prospective laws which prevents the danger of ruling by arbitrary power. 18 However, we should question whether the RoL as such (representing legal certainty, predictability and accessibility as proposed by Bingham) is necessary, as its component principles already exist in the British constitution. As Raz himself noted, the RoL is only one of the virtues of today’s laws. 19 Indeed, we can find traces of the RoL, in terms of certainty and predictability, in laws. But it is highly questionable whether the constitutional system really requires the umbrella term of the RoL when other, clearer and better established (or at least established to the degree valuable for them to be) legal principles serve a similar purpose. Looking at the RoL as one of law’s inherent virtues, as presented by Raz, the descriptiveness of the concept is additionally reaffirmed by some substantive accounts, like Dworkin’s. His position that the RoL does not stipulate only the narrow ‘rule-book conception’, but that the concept encapsulates people’s moral and political rights,20 calls for rebuttal. With strong emphasis on substantive justice, rights, and even morality, the rights conception cannot introduce a universal RoL concept, and can only describe the understanding of these elements in a specific jurisdiction. After all, even the judge Hercules must rely on the “convictions of his nation’s character”. 21 Since, as argued by this article, the RoL is not a prescriptive concept, conformity is not required. Despite Raz’s, Bingham’s and others’ explanations, the concept still lacks a dominant uniform definition (which is not atypical for such abstract terms) which only reaffirms its inability to be conformed with. For a better understanding of the concept, two solutions, though both inadequate to resolve the problem, can be proposed. If Raz tried to present conformity to the RoL as conformity to legal certainty, this should have been stated more directly and not under the (overly) generic concept of the RoL. While this definition would contribute to eliminating uncertainty, it would not contribute to defining the RoL, as it would act only as a restatement of other principles and would be essentially without its own essence. On the other hand, keeping the scope of the concept wide would distinguish the RoL from other principles but would also cause it to suffer from disproportionate conceptual uncertainty, rendering any potential prescriptive basis of the concept impossible to establish. This leads us to the fundamental problem explored by this article and to the problem pointed out by Raz himself that the RoL should not be taken blindly, on trust,22 which would be the only option when there is no clear definition. As opposed to the theories discussed above, Griffith’s sceptical views destroy the concept as a whole but tend to be the most revealing. Griffith saw the RoL as essentially a political concept. 23 Notwithstanding the lack of clear definition, the concept became “sacred and untouchable”24 and its special status is being maintained and reinforced by those who oppose any change of status quo – politicians. 25 In addition to that, the RoL is also a common reference made by the judiciary in their judgments; Privacy International 26 being one of the most prominent examples. The Supreme Court emphasised the importance of effective judicial review in upholding the RoL and argued that the ouster clause in s. 67(8) of RIPA 2000 27 does not disqualify the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. Nevertheless, the Court still did not fully overrule Parliament and ultimately recognised Parliament’s supremacy, stating that the ouster clause can exclude jurisdiction of judicial review when stated in “the most clear and explicit words”. 28 However, according to Griffith, even the judiciary uses the RoL as a fig leaf 29 which allows them to exercise political power and should therefore not be considered as a strictly legalistic concept.  The incompatibility of the rule of law with the institutional framework : In this section, we turn to the issue of incompatibility of the RoL as interpreted in the aforementioned accounts and as a prescriptive concept with the British institutional framework. Aristotle contrasted the rule of law, as a state where rulers are constrained by laws, with the rule of individuals, as a state where rulers govern arbitrarily. 30 However, we ought to question whether we can distinguish between these two alternatives in the context of the British constitutional system. Laws are made by people – whether in the form of an individual or an assembly. 31 As argued by Loughlin, laws are a “human creation” and can therefore not be placed above human will or government of men. Laws are unable to rule because ruling requires action. 32 Humans are needed to enforce the law and, in that way, it is them who rule with laws. The state is therefore both the source and the subject of law,33 which means that in practice, the lawmaker (Parliament) is not always (or does not have to be) constrained by the law because all the power to change it lies in its hands. In enacting new laws, Parliament is realistically not accountable to anyone – not even to the already existing laws. 34 The role of the Government will be analysed in the following section. The reason for this is parliamentary sovereignty. The power of the Parliament to “make or unmake any law whatever” as described by Dicey 35 prevents the UK from having a prescriptive RoL in the sense of Bingham’s, Dicey’s and Raz’s interpretations in its legal system. Dicey provided his famous definition of parliamentary sovereignty, but also emphasised the importance of the second fundamental principle – the RoL. He argued that the two principles are not counterbalancing forces since Parliament favours the supremacy of the law. 36 He pointed out two RoL characteristics in the British constitution: the stringent procedural requirements of the legislative process and supremacy of the law enforcing parliamentary sovereignty. The flaw of the former will be analysed in the following section whereas the issue of the latter characteristic is discussed here. Dicey argued that the RoL constrains discretionary power of the government and reinforces the power of Parliament. 37 Indeed, we cannot claim that the government’s exercise of power is not checked. Judicial review plays an important role in the court’s scrutiny of the legality, reasonableness and procedural propriety of the executive and administrative actions but does not play an important role in the context of the RoL. 38 The more appropriate concept used would be rule by law,39 concentrating on the executive function, which is the primary task of the government. This concept also has much stronger prescriptive value, since compliance is required directly by the courts in judicial review. However, according to Schmitt, this concept should not be equated with the RoL, since rule by law can be found even in an absolute monarchy, with the monarch’s will being the law. 40 While an absolute monarchy and judicial review are not two consonant concepts, the mechanism of judicial review could potentially be established in this kind of regime with the aim of scrutinising public bodies’ execution of laws, irrespective of the fact that the laws are the will of the monarch. In this sense, the law is the essential means through which governing is administered. 41 Yet, this concept alone is inadequate for guaranteeing that institutional conditions make everything, and everyone subordinate to law because parliamentary sovereignty, as the central concept in British constitution, prevents that. Rule by law and the procedure of judicial review are therefore not concerned with the way the law was enacted, which occupies a dominant position in the rule of law. The famous Entick v Carrington 42 case emphasised the notion of legality, supporting the idea of rule by law, but it constitutes only a part of the RoL definition, applying to the idea of implementing laws and not legislating. These laws are still not supreme on their own – as explained in the previous section, it is the Parliament that makes and unmakes them. The Government is certainly obliged to follow the laws enacted by Parliament, but their existence is very much dependent on the latter institution. Judicial review therefore scrutinises compliance with laws made by Parliament and protects laws, which ultimately protects parliamentary sovereignty;43 hence, the authority of the institution and not the law itself. In this spirit, the power of Parliament to legislate is not limited by any principle, and therefore Parliament always prevails over the RoL. This suggests that Dicey was wrong in asserting that the RoL is a constraint on the government. The RoL should actually be considered in the relationship with the law-maker – Parliament – to find who holds the supreme authority. The question arising from Dicey’s argument that parliamentary sovereignty and the RoL work hand in hand is: Can there be two supreme bodies – the body of Parliament and the body of law? Parliament undoubtedly favours supremacy of the law once the law is created, insofar as it correspondingly guarantees Parliament’s authority. If the law stops serving the purpose Parliament intended it to serve, it will create a new law or repeal old law, regardless of the legitimacy of its decision. Thus, the concept cannot be prescriptive because it is theoretically irreconcilable with the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty which allows Parliament to enact any law, even if it goes against certain RoL principles. The contemporary state of the British constitution allows us to trace the characteristics of the RoL in it but that does not mean that actors are guided by this principle or even compelled to observe it. It is important to remember that the question here is not “will Parliament repeal the supremacy of law, including the law over legislative procedure?” but “can Parliament repeal supremacy of law and change the law over its legislative procedure?” The fact that Parliament cannot bind its successors 44 does not change the argument – the law can still be changed for at least the mandate of the Parliament in question. Similarly, Parliament can also change its procedural rules of the legislating process which will be discussed in the next section. Parliament has many times demonstrated willingness to create laws preventing citizens from damaging the state’s interests, with the RoL being evidently ignored. While the example might seem exceptional, it nevertheless portrays that Parliament can act contrary to the RoL. In Burmah Oil Company v Lord Advocate,45 the House of Lords decided that the British Government should have compensated Burmah Oil Company for damages done on their oil fields by British soldiers during the Second World War. In response to that, Parliament enacted the War Damage Act 1965, which retrospectively exempted the UK government from liability for war-related damages. This action goes against Bingham’s and Raz’s emphasis on prospectivity in the RoL. Moreover, the 1965 Act manifests the power vested in Parliament through parliamentary sovereignty which is above the courts’ decisions and above any specific law. The constitution does not guarantee the RoL but the rule of people, with no law being above the will of humans.  The rule of law in the context of the modern political system : In this section, the article will explore the use of the RoL as a political slogan and discuss the impossibility of embedding the RoL in Britain’s political structure. The British constitution is based on the Westminster model. While power is divided into three branches of government, the traditional notion of the separation of powers, as proposed by Montesquieu, 46 does not apply in the UK political context. 47 The Westminster Model in reality blurs the line between the legislative and executive branch. As a result, the party with the majority in the House of Commons both forms the government and also dominates the legislative process. 48 Because of parliamentary sovereignty, the executive gains de facto sovereignty through its dual role in the legislative branch. The ruler is effectively also the legislator. It is true that a bill must go through the amending process of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, but in reality, the executive has proven to be well equipped to achieve its goals through procedural obstacles or even by modifying such obstacles. One example is the Parliament Act 1911. In 1911, Lloyd George’s Liberal government proposed the Parliament Bill, which downgraded the power of the House of Lords in the legislative process. While all procedural requirements were observed in enacting the 1911 Act, the government clearly pressured the House of Lords to give their consent to the Act for their political purposes of developing social welfare. 49 This is a primary example of the power of the executive changing the procedural laws when those do not serve them, without needing to perform a coup d’état. Contrary to Dicey’s theory which emphasised that the RoL is maintained by procedural safeguards in the process of legislating,50 the procedure did not provide any safeguard in this case. Since the Liberals and the coalition prevailed with their votes in the House of Commons and the Lords were passing the bill under a threat from the king to reconfigure the House, the goal of removing procedural backstops for all the future law-making was achieved purely through political conduits. In this sense, any law could be modified according to the wish of the ruling party, even if the change entailed major implications for legislative process and the structure of Parliament by, as Baroness Hale said: “redefining [Parliament] downwards”. 51 The RoL is impotent in a battle with the rule of people. It was the laws that were adapted to the government’s position and not the government’s position adapted to the laws. It must be noted that while this is not an everyday occurrence, it is these rare cases that demonstrate our legal reality and how state actors are allowed to exercise their powers in practice. This observation leads us to exploring the RoL as a protection from arbitrariness, as emphasised by Raz. 52 According to Schmitt, in the RoL, a legal norm should be distinguishable from the rule of persons “whether it is an individual person, an assembly, or body whose will takes the place of a general norm that is equal for all and determined in advance”. 53 Even though the alterations in the Parliament Act 1911 were proposed by the government (and not one single dictator), its enactment still contradicts Raz’s premise of protection from arbitrariness. Raz acknowledged the extent of power given to the government by law and proposed the RoL as a procedural safeguard against the danger of arbitrariness. 54 Even though the Parliament Act went through all the stages of the legislative process and was therefore not arbitrarily made, substantive arbitrariness of the Government’s pursuit of its agenda permeated through the safeguards and nothing like the RoL prevents a similar enactment from taking place again. While the institutional conditions may protect the integrity of the system of rules,55 this protection is not always guaranteed, and certainly not via the concept of the RoL.  Looking towards the future : The concept remains ill-defined and vulnerable to potential abuses. That is why the RoL, as a prescriptive concept, should be removed from common use by both politicians and the judiciary. It should only be explored together with other abstract principles and aspirations promising a better and more just tomorrow (at least until a more uniform definition is found). Nevertheless, in its current state, the RoL cannot provide that. On the contrary, making false pretences and creating the impression of fictitious protection is precarious and threatens the permeation of arbitrariness and dictatorial regime into the British legal system. Alternatively, in order to make the concept suitable for concrete use not only in political but also legal context, Parliament could consider codifying the RoL in an Act of Parliament and providing a uniform definition. By converting it into valid law, the institutions of the state would be legally obliged to follow the principle. Nevertheless, this solution should be recognised as defective for two reasons: firstly, there is no guarantee that this Act of Parliament would have longevity due to the no entrenchment rule. Secondly, the lack of uniform definition and the inherent vagueness both stand as major barriers on the path towards codification. Also, the fact that other legal principles possibly covered by the RoL, such as legal certainty and prospectivity, are to a great extent observed by lawmakers, the umbrella term of the RoL appears to be redundant in the context of the British constitution. CONCLUSION: This article has demonstrated that the reason for the RoL being repeatedly violated and yet not being properly condemned or even judicially sanctioned is that the concept does not play any substantial role in the British constitutional regime. In fact, it does not really exist in the prescriptive sense. The RoL is desperately deprived of a concrete definition, which renders it unsuitable to be incorporated into the system as one of the constitutional principles. Moreover, the concept can only be recognised in a descriptive form while still being greatly incompatible with institutions of British constitution and being circumvented or even abused in the political context. The safest option for both the legal system and citizens would be to remove it altogether from our legal and political structure. Nevertheless, it appears to be much too useful for creating vagueness and false impression of untouchability of laws to be forgotten so easily.

    "body": "2021/04/09 - Introduction The invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in the advent of the Schrems II case raises a plethora of concerns for the UK’s free flow of data to the European Economic Area (EEA) post-Brexit. With the instant invalidation of the Privacy Shield agreement relied upon by over 5000 corporations within the EU and the US1, transborder data flows have been severely affected as a result of mandating heightened data protection assessments when transferring data out of the EU. This blog piece aims to analyse the Schrems II case and its application to the UK’s current data protection regime to determine if the UK will be granted an ‘adequacy status’. It will assess the UK’s legislative responses to jurisprudence from the Court of Justice of the European Union and discuss how these may act as impediments which prevent the European Commission from reaching an adequacy decision. Finally, this article will evaluate the implications of not being granted an ‘adequacy status’ on the UK’s transborder data flows to the EU upon the expiry of the transition period.      1) What is an ‘adequacy status’ and why does it matter? An ‘adequacy status’ is granted by the European Commission to non-EU countries – which are known as third countries wishing to have free and unimpeded data flow within the European Economic Area. It is granted when a third country’s data protection regime is deemed to provide a level of protection which is ‘essentially  equivalent’2 to EU law. In evaluating the third country’s legal regime, the European Commission looks at, inter alia, the extent to which the rule of law respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, the means of judicial redress afforded to data subjects and the effective functioning of an independent supervisory authority enforcing compliance with data protection rules. 3 With the UK becoming a ‘third country’ vis-à-vis the EU, not being granted an adequacy status by the European Commission would result in companies having to resort to alternative methods of legal compliance under the GDPR. Therefore, analysing the legislative frameworks pertaining to the UK in light of Schrems II will allow for the extrapolation of whether such frameworks might be deemed adequate by the European Commission.   Analysing whether the UK will be granted an adequacy status also matters in the context of the UK being provided with a six month interim period by the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement4 which stipulates terms on which the EU and the UK will trade following the end of the implementation period on the 31st of December. The Agreement provides that for an interim period lasting 6 months (from the 1st of January 2021), data flows from the EEA to the UK will not be considered as transfers to a third country under EU law. Therefore, the UK has an additional 6 months to ensure that their data protection laws are fully compatible with Schrems II upon the expiry of the interim period.    2) Will the UK be granted an ‘adequacy status’ in light of Schrems II? The Schrems II5 case arose following the CJEU’s invalidation of the Safe Harbour Agreement in Schrems I in 2015 and concerned a complaint against Facebook. Privacy advocate Max Schrems contended that US surveillance schemes processing data transferred from Facebook Ireland Ltd. to its parent company in the US, Facebook Inc. conflicts with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the rights enshrined in the European Charter of Human Rights. 6 While Schrems II was concerned with surveillance schemes adopted by US security agencies and their nonconformity with EU law, the principles elucidated by the CJEU can shed light as to whether an adequacy decision might be granted to the UK. Grounds for the Invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield In Schrems II, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated on two grounds.   (a) The mass surveillance of data by US AgenciesThe mass surveillance of data by section 702 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Executive Order 12333 permit the collection of information from EU data subjects in bulk to obtain foreign intelligence information. In Schrems II, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that the surveillance of EU data has not been limited to what is strictly necessary7 thus breaching the principle of proportionality. 8 9 In particular, the CJEU ruled that Art. 7 and 8 of the Charter10 stipulating the right to private and family life and protection of personal data respectively were violated as the interference with EU data subjects’ rights and freedoms for national security purposes “go beyond the restrictions necessary in a democratic society”. 11    Applying this to the UK, it is questionable whether UK national security and surveillance law is proportionate to its restrictions. A historical chronology of the development of UK legislative frameworks on surveillance would further illustrate this.                      Requirements for Data Interception under the Investigatory Powers ActFollowing the enactment of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) in 2014, the Tele2/Watson 12 case challenging UK and Swedish data retention laws concluded that the DRIPA framework does not comply with the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58. In particular, the court held that DRIPA’s legislative framework breached the requirement of retaining data to prevent a “serious risk” to public security and permitted warrants for bulk acquisition of data without notifying individuals that their data was being accessed. 13 Three criteria can be extracted from the CJEU judgment on how DRIPA had to be reformed to comply with the e-Privacy Directive:14      (i)           Security Intelligence Agencies (SIAs) must access metadata for a narrow set of purposes  (ii)          Prior independent review must take place before authorising data interception (iii)         Data acquisition/retention must be proportionate and targeted towards specific data subjects who must be informed of their data being processed   Arguably, the first criteria has been addressed because a narrow set of purposes has been stipulated in the IPA about metadata that can be retained by SIAs. 15 An exhaustive list has been added to the IPA whereby processing must be justified according to one of six purposes including “interests of national security” and an “applicable crime purpose”. The second criterion has been also addressed through the IPA by introducing a “double lock” for the interception of warrants whereby warrants/notices must be approved by the Secretary of State and subsequently by the Investigatory Powers Commission prior to being authorised for use in data retention. 16 This introduced a more robust framework for authorising the use of warrants for data interception.      However, the third criteria extrapolated from the judgement has not been met as the Act stipulates that the Secretary of State’s power to authorise a warrant would be considered proportionate as long as data retention is justified according to one of six purposes. 17 This fails to ensure that data retention is targeted to certain data subjects or a specific class of individuals whose data must be processed according to the justified purpose. 18 This is analogous to s. 702 FISA discussed in Schrems II where data retention was not targeted and consequently found to be disproportionate. It is therefore clear that both the US and UK data protection SIAs use “national security” as a blanket defence for disproportionate processing of data in bulk. Furthermore, s. 174 of the IPA makes it an offence for telecommunication providers to disclose to any person, “without reasonable excuse”, the contents of a warrant. 19 The Act potentially implies that informing data subjects of their data being processed is an offence unless authorised by the Secretary of State. This will likely act as an impediment to being granted an adequacy status as the legislation’s default position should be informing data subjects unless there is a legitimate reason not to.   In light of the previous analysis which highlights that the IPA framework fails to ensure proportionate data acquisition that is transparently disclosed to all affected data subjects, the response of the minister of State for Media and Data20 to the questions posed by the European Scrutiny Committee is concerning. By praising the IPA as “robust, transparent and world-leading”21, Sir William Cash MP seems give too much merit to the UK legislative framework given the third criterion from the Tele2/Watson judgement that has not been addressed. National Security Considerations in the Investigatory Powers Act The IPA framework has been deemed indiscriminate and disproportionate for protecting national security in the Privacy International case. 22 In the case, Privacy International, a UK based charity defending rights to privacy bought a case before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the UK Security23 and Intelligence24 Agencies challenging the legality of processing bulk communications within the IPA framework due to not being compliant with the E-Privacy Directive and not fully addressing issues identified by Tele2/Watson.  However, the UK government argued that the E-privacy Directive does not apply to its processing activities as according to Art. 4(2) of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU)25, “national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state”. Since processing occurred for national security purposes, the UK government argued that the E-Privacy Directive does not apply due to national security falling outside the competency of EU law. 26 While the CJEU focused on whether EU law has primacy over data processing in the context of national security,27 it also considered whether general and indiscriminate retention of data is permissible under national security purposes as a secondary point.   Regarding the question of whether national security falls within the competence of EU law, the CJEU ruled that while it is the responsibility of Member States to determine their own security measures, such measures must be in accordance with EU law. 28 However, in Schrems II, the CJEU precluded the application of Art. 4(2) TEU to the US legal regime as the US is not an EU Member State. 29 Therefore, while both Schrems II and Privacy International concerned data processing in the context of ‘national security’, it is clear that the UK government availed of the applicability of the TEU to exclude the disproportionate processing of bulk data by SIAs from the scope of EU law. This, however, will no longer be the case because the UK can no longer take advantage of TEU following the expiry of the transition period.   However, the CJEU in Privacy International affirmed the applicability of EU law to SIAs processing activities and reiterate what has been discussed in the Schrems II CJEU judgement regarding general and indiscriminate data collection by SIAs for national security purposes, whereby data processing must be proportionate, strictly necessary and targeted according to Art. 15(1) of the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC. 30 Therefore, while Privacy International did not evaluate the substantive flaws of the IPA framework, analysing it in conjunction with Schrems II affirms that more robust safeguards for data subjects in the context of national security must be put in place for the UK and the US to be deemed to provide a level of protection “essentially equivalent” to EU law. Contextualising this with Tele2/Watson shows that the IPA framework must address the criteria extracted from the judgment for Sir William Cash MP to describe the IPA as “robust, transparent and world-leading”. Considerations under the EU-UK Trade Agreement It is vital to draw to attention that Article FINPROV. 10A of the EU-UK Trade Agreement31 stipulates that if the UK changes its data protection law for reasons other than complying with the EU data protection regime, the interim period automatically comes to an end and the UK becomes a third country vis-à-vis the EU. It is arguable that through this provision, the UK is promising not to use bulk interception of data for national security reasons as the incompatibility of this with EU law has been affirmed through CJEU jurisprudence in Privacy International. Nevertheless, the UK agreeing not to use bulk interception of data is not enough for being granted an adequacy finding upon the expiry of such period.    Therefore, it is concluded that in order to ensure that the processing of data is proportionate and strictly necessary according to Schrems II, the IPA must address the substantive issues raised in Tele2/Watson by ensuring that data retention is proportionate and targeted, whilst safeguarding data subjects’ by making them fully aware of their data being processed. Hence, at its current form, the IPA framework is not fully “robust, transparent and world-leading”. With the interim period ending on the 1st of July and no reforms being enacted, both judgements read in light of Schrems II present a major setback for the UK obtaining an adequacy decision (pursuant to Art. 45, GDPR).        (b)  Means for Judicial RedressThe second ground as to why the EU-US Privacy Shield was nullified relates to insufficient means for judicial redress. The creation of the Ombudsperson under the Privacy Shield was declared insufficient by the CJEU because individuals are not able to bring legal action before an impartial and independent court. 32 The CJEU justified this point by stating that the “ombudsperson is appointed by the Secretary of State and is an integral part of the US State Department”33thereby alluding to the fact that the judicial body (ombudsperson) is not free from the pressure of the executive. This is detrimental to the impartiality of the ombudsperson who is not able to exert autonomy when making judgements. Furthermore, the CJEU state that although recital 120 of the Privacy Shield agreement stipulates the commitment of the US Government to ensuring that the “Privacy Shield Ombudsperson” corrects violations from SIAs, no provision in the agreement affirms or indicates the “power” of the ombudsperson to adopt decisions that are legally binding on SIAs. 34 In light of these issues, the CJEU ruled that the level of protection afforded by the ombudsperson is not “essentially equivalent” to EU law which enshrines a “right to an effective remedy and fair trial” through Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. 35 As such, two criteria can be extracted from the Schrems II case that must be met for the UK to be granted an adequacy status: (1) that the judicial body responsible for data surveillance issues must be independent and impartial and (2) that the judicial body must have the power to issue legally binding decisions.   Starting with the first criteria, it is clear that an independent tribunal, specifically, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has been exclusively empowered to hear complaints against the regime and provide redress. This is affirmed through the case of Big Brothers Watch v UK36 which concerned, inter alia, whether the IPT complies with Article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights. Since the convention has been woven into EU jurisprudence through the European Charter of Human Rights37, the case provides salient observations on the impartiality of the IPT. The ECtHR ruled that the IPT functions as an independent body and that hosting meetings with Security Services such as MI5 does not undermine the tribunal’s impartiality insofar as fairness, justice and procedural regularity for court hearings are concerned. 38 The ECtHR additionally ruled that the tribunal is exempt from having public hearings in instances where information disclosed from parties pertains to national security and that this does not infringe on the transparency of the tribunal and thus its impartiality in the eyes of the public. 39 Moving to the second criteria, the ability of the IPT to issue legally binding decisions against the executive branch (i. e. government) is evidenced through the case of Liberty40. The IPT ruled in the case that Article 8 and Article 10 of the ECHR enshrining the right to private and family life and the right to freedom of expression respectively have not been “in accordance with the law”41 as necessary in a democratic society and have thus been violated.  Liberty was the first case ruled by the IPT that was found against the government and proved that the judicial framework for redress is more effective than the ombudsperson mechanism in the US as the executive branch can be held accountable when contravening the law. The effectiveness of the IPT in being able to challenge the executive is furthermore demonstrated in the case of Belhadj &amp; Others42 where Security Services’ surveillance schemes (operating under the auspices of the government) were found to contravene the Regulation of the Investigatory Powers Act 2000. 43 Another indication that does not directly fall within the Schrems II independent tribunal criteria but could act as an advantage for the UK being granted an adequacy is section 242 of the Investigatory Powers Act 2018,44 which allows parties to appeal from decisions concluded in the IPT to the Court of Appeal. This domestic route of appeal ostensibly provides individuals with further access to judicial redress which is a promising step towards the UK being granted an adequacy decision.      As such, the UK has an effective judicial redress framework and this could act as an advantage when the European Commission considers granting the adequacy status.     3) What if the UK is not granted an ‘adequacy status’? If the UK is not granted an ‘adequacy status’, companies wishing to import/export data from the EEA must resort to alternative methods of legal compliance such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). 45 The case holds that companies using SCCs must implement additional safeguards by assessing SCCs on a case-by-case basis in context of the third country’s legal regime. 46 Despite the ICO amending the SCC template following Schrems II to maximise protection by design,47 corporations do not have any guidelines as to how they can assess data exports. This creates practical difficulties for UK corporations relying on SCCs (in the event of no adequacy being granted) as they are obliged by the Schrems II judgement to revisit their terms to establish a comprehensive framework not undermining data subjects’ rights under Art. 44,48 albeit with no guidelines from the ICO on how such protection can be fulfilled.   With such an onerous burden, corporations will likely apply divergent levels of understanding when assessing data exports which runs the risk of not achieving the wider GDPR policy objective of data protection. However, the severity of this burden in light of the Schrems II case remains unaffected in the context of UK companies as firstly, the UK will not be regarded as a third country during the six-month interim period according to the EU-UK Trade Agreement and secondly, the UK legislature has transposed GDPR laws locally through the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications statutory instrument49 which mirrors the GDPR and thus evidences the UK’s continued compliance with EU law and jurisprudence in Schrems II. Given the fact that BCRs create legally binding internal rules for data transfers approved by a data protection authority in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR, they are seen as a more feasible and durable method of alternative legal compliance due to not being subject to the same protective standard applied to SCCs in Schrems II. 50 UK companies relying on BCRs enjoy a greater deal of flexibility as the competent supervisory authority does not need to evidence ‘non-material updates to BCRs’ thus saving time and costs. 51 However, it should be noted that BCRs are not practically useful as they exclusively apply to data transfers within a corporate group. 52 The practical utility of BCRs may thus be limited because they cannot enable wider data transfers outside the corporate groups.   Art. 49 derogations53 are an alternative method of legal compliance that can be applied to a very limited set of circumstances and can be used when SCCs or BCRs cannot be utilised. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) applies stringent criteria when authorising data transfers under Art. 49 derogations whereby the transborder transfer of data must be strictly necessary for one of seven derogations recognised by the EBDP. 54 For instance, if the derogation relied upon is “necessary for the performance of a contract”,55 the EBDP must establish, inter alia, a “close and substantial connection between the transfer and purpose of the contract”. 56 The stringent criteria applied by the EBDP when authorising data transfers under Art. 49 derogations indicate that they must be used as a last resort and are thus not of practical utility to firms in the event of no adequacy being granted.     Hence, it seems SCCs  are the only option which corporations can rely on for data transfers to the EEA in the event of no adequacy being granted; although their application remains highly uncertain in light of Schrems II. ConclusionThis blog piece aims to shed light on the implications of the Schrems II case on post-Brexit data flows in the context of cases decided by the CJEU that highlight areas that must undergo legislative reform to ensure an adequacy status is granted.   Since the interim period stipulated in the EU-UK Trade Agreement is due to expire on the 1st of July, the UK parliament has a six-month period through which it must urgently enact legislative reforms following issues raised in Schrems II concerning proportionality of data processing as well as issues regarding indiscriminate retention of bulk data and the lack of safeguards in the IPA framework according to Privacy International and Tele2/Watson to ensure an adequacy status is granted. It is concluded that in the event of no adequacy being granted upon the expiry of the interim period, companies seeking unencumbered EU-UK data flows must rely on alternative methods of legal compliance. Given the narrow transfer of data within the remit of BCRs and the stringent criteria applied to Art. 49 derogations which must be used as a last resort, companies have no choice but to rely on SCCs which create onerous burdens on firms given the lack of guidance from data protection authorities including the ICO.

    "title": "My Body, My Choice: How Might Artificial Wombs Endanger the Viability Doctrine? Limits to Abortion, Criminalisation and Reconciling the Maternal/Fetal Balance",
    "body": "2021/04/06 - I. IntroductionScientific research suggests that the implementation of artificial wombs for human fetuses (ectogenesis) is foreseeable within the next few decades,1 having already been used successfully for lamb fetuses. 2 However, the current law is ill-equipped to deal with the conflict of rights which will ensue. Ectogenesis will reshape pre-natal viability and procedures, decreasing the mortality rate of extremely premature fetuses. As such, it will have a direct impact on the stage at which a fetus is deemed to be viable. 3 Under the current law, viability is an important criterion for criminalising the termination of an unborn fetus. This article focuses on how Artificial Womb Technology (AWT) may limit the right to abortion. Furthermore, it will argue that reform is required to rebalance the maternal/fetal interest in abortion law, specifically focusing on how future legislation should classify AWT in order to restore the doctrine of viability. While this article recognises that abortion is an ethically-charged issue, it does not aim to discuss the ethical implications of abortion. Instead, it will focus on proposing a solution to ensure that the right to abortion is protected in the advent of AWT, and to shed light on an impending dilemma with huge legal implications on the current application of abortion laws. II. The Offence of Child DestructionSection 1(1) of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 provides that:  “Any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother, shall be guilty… of child destruction. ” Whilst originally this was not intended to be concerned with abortion,4 it is now accepted that an unlawful abortion could fall within the scope of this offence. In C v S,5 a putative father challenged the potential abortion of his unborn child. The courts contemplated whether an abortion would constitute a criminal offence under the IL(P)A 1929. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal found that the child was not capable of being born alive, and the doctor would thus not be guilty of the offence. The extensive and detailed judicial application of the aspects of the born alive test in this case indicate that the courts did not preclude the possibility that the offence (under the IL(P)A 1929) could apply to abortion. 6 The applicability of child destruction to unlawful abortion was confirmed in Rance v Mid-Downs Health Authority. 7 Brooke J, in determining whether an abortion of a disabled fetus was lawful, stated that the abortion would be “prima facie rendered lawful under… the Act of 1967, provided it did not involve the destruction of the life of a child ‘capable of being born alive,’ contrary to section 1 of the Act of 1929”. 8 He applied the born alive test stating that “The question of mixed fact and law” is whether the fetus  “would have been a child capable of being born alive”. 9 Whilst the fetus was not found to meet this threshold, Brooke J’s application of the test evidences that an unlawful abortion could fall within the scope of the child destruction offence. 10 Further evidence of the applicability of child destruction to abortion was given in a Parliamentary debate in 1988. Lord Skelmersdale expressed the notion that “because of the interaction between” the IL(P)A and the Abortion Act (AA) 1967,11 child destruction has evolved into a possible prosecutorial tool against unlawful abortion by placing “a de facto limit below which a doctor performing an abortion has the benefit of an automatic defence. ”12 Essentially, the offence of child destruction catches any procedures which fall outside of the AA 1967’s criteria. Furthermore, the AA 1967 supports the notion that the offence of child destruction is still relevant today.  Section 5 states that:  “(1) No offence under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 shall be committed by a registered medical practitioner who terminates a pregnancy in accordance with the provisions of this Act.  (2) For the purposes of the law relating to abortion, anything done with intent to procure a woman’s miscarriage … is unlawfully done unless authorised by section 1 of this Act”. As such, the AA 1967 restricts the scope of the offence of child destruction but does not replace it. It indicates the offence is still very much relevant to abortion if the procedure is performed outside of the conditions provided by Section 1.   Accordingly, when Section 5 was inserted into the AA 1967 in 1990, Parliament made the express decision to retain child destruction’s applicability to abortion.  Thus, the IL(P)A 1929 implies that a viable fetus has an interest in life, which may only be circumscribed in the circumstances provided by paragraphs (b) to (d) of S1(1) AA 1967. Strangely, the Abortion Act never became the sole authority on abortion by replacing the IL(P)A, especially considering the intermission between the latter and the enactment and amendments to the former. Romanis argues that this was a deliberate decision by the legislature. 13 This is an ostensible indication of Parliament’s intention to continue to criminalise the abortion of viable fetuses, by, in theory, not instating the Abortion Act as the sole authority, but essentially as a defence to child destruction. Evidence of this ‘deliberate decision’ can be demonstrated in a 1988 debate rejecting the report of a Select Committee which suggested the IL(P)A’s ‘born alive’ test be disengaged from Section 5(1) of the AA 1967. 14 Lord Robertson fervently objected to this, asserting that “a cardinal principle is that abortion should not be allowed where the child is capable of being born alive. ” 15 He suggested that the AA 1967’s viability threshold is meant to serve as an “upper limit”, and thus to depart from the IL(P)A’s test was “wrong”. 16 Therefore, Romanis is well-founded in her argument that the legislature deliberately maintained the distinction between the two Acts. In plain, the offence of child destruction seems to affirm the importance of the viability doctrine within English law. The purpose of criminalising the abortion of a viable fetus is, prima facie, the protection of the fetus. Accordingly, a maternal/fetal balance can be observed as an interest of the law.   III. The Right to AbortionIn contrast, the right to abortion protects a woman’s autonomy and has been recognised as a fundamental right in many states. 17 The Roe v Wade 18 decision in the United States is an illustration of this - the Supreme Court recognised that abortion was within the constitutional right of privacy, stating that “the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision”. 19 Under  English law, the AA 1967 legalises abortion in a broad range of circumstances provided in Section 1(1)(a)-(d): when it is clear that continuing the pregnancy involves risk to the woman, which must become even graver after the twenty-four week threshold, or that the fetus suffers from severe abnormalities. The legality of abortion in these circumstances essentially provides a defence to the child destruction offence under the IL(P)A 1929. Moreover, it is a well-established principle that the fetus has no legal personhood, under any circumstances, before birth. 20 In Paton v British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees,21 the court held that, as a matter grounded in common law, “The foetus cannot… have a right of its own at least until it is born and has a separate existence from its mother”. 22 However, after viability, which is the point from which the fetus is developed enough to live “indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems”,23 the IL(P)A 1929 implies that a fetus gains  an interest to be born by imposing criminal sanctions on its killing, providing the fetus with what is possibly the only legal protection it will receive pre-birth. Correspondingly, some academics argue that abortion is not a right in the UK, instead, it is merely a procedure that can take place if the correct medical criteria (set out in Section 1 of the AA 1967) are met. 24 The weight of this argument is reinforced by the aforementioned criminalisation of any abortion performed outside of the context of the AA 1967. Nevertheless, such a viewpoint ostensibly discounts the importance of human rights jurisprudence, which indicates that access to abortion is gradually evolving into a positive right. For instance, the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that access to legal abortion is linked to the right to private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In Tysiąc v Poland,25 the court held that a state cannot escape a procedural obligation to make abortion available where the law allows it. Whilst this is a development in Strasbourg’s abortion jurisprudence from the decision of Brüggemann and Scheuten v Germany,26 which held that a woman’s choice with her pregnancy is not concerned with Article 8, it focuses on the procedural aspects of the law, and suggests that Strasbourg is reserved in deciding “substantive violations” of abortion as a fundamental right. 27 In Tysiąc, the court accepted that a state cannot prohibit abortion for therapeutic reasons (to protect the mother’s life). Here, the state still owes procedural safeguards due to its “measures affecting fundamental human rights”. 28 However, it was asserted that “once the legislature decides to allow abortion, it must not structure its legal framework in a way which would limit real possibilities to obtain it”. 29 Strasbourg’s stance, therefore, affirms “that women’s right to access legal abortion may not be illusory”,30 but for now is unprepared to address any substantive issues of abortion. Accordingly, abortion is a right which is becoming increasingly recognised by law. This could be threatened if English law cannot keep pace with the technological advancements in the field of neonatal care. IV. Implications of Artificial Womb TechnologyIV(a). The change in viability and the effect on criminalisation(i).   Impact of  AWT on the viability doctrineAWT will inevitably have implications on the doctrine of viability. Viability is a seemingly blurred concept as a judicial tool,31 yet tries to classify fetal status upon which the legality of an abortion is usually based. In the UK, the AA 1967 places viability at twenty-four weeks, before which most abortions should take place to avoid prosecution. However, the real question of viability is naturally much more nuanced, and each case has its own subtleties which make a certain answer almost impossible. 32 AWT would further impede this because a fetus would reach viability before the AA 1967’s twenty-four week threshold in the sense that “if removed, it could fully gestate” within ectogenesis. 33 To that end, Parliament might consider removing the threshold as it will no longer be an accurate reflection of viability.  While this may appear speculative, it seems a likely course of action considering that AWT will destabilise the current understanding of viability which is integral to abortion law. 34 Accordingly, the retention of any quantitative measure of viability will become very difficult where an embryo could be deemed viable from conception. Furthermore, unless Parliament can find another way to balance the rights of the mother and fetus without the doctrine of viability, which risks being made obsolete by AWT, it is possible that they will elect to retain the pre-existing ‘capable of being born alive’ test under the IL(P)A 1929. This is again likely due to the discretionary nature of the test, which may allow the question of viability in the era of AWT to be dealt with by the scientific understanding at the time. As many academics have agreed, “there is not a sufficient replacement for the standard of viability” and any possible alternatives “are flawed” in the absence of abortion jurisprudence not based upon viability. 35 Consequently, the most desirable solution to this dilemma would be to somehow retain viability, or the balance of interests would shift entirely to the mother or fetus, undercutting the temporal compromise that the law has endeavoured to achieve. (ii).   Will the IL(P)A's  'capable of being born alive threshold' limit access to abortion if AWT is deemed a factor of viability?If Parliament opts to retain the ‘born alive’ test, it will be deleterious to abortion access. Fetal viability would be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on factors such as abnormalities. The lack of a clear and quantitative threshold would naturally leave the question of viability to the courts unless Parliament expressly rejected viability as a judicial tool upon the advent of AWT. As Sir John Donaldson MR stated in C v S, the IL(P)A test, whilst being subject to medical evidence, “essentially depends upon the interpretation of the statute and is a matter for the courts”. 36 However, increased judicial discretion would render courts the gatekeeper to abortion. Judges are not medical professionals and often rely on medical evidence, which would suggest that a fetus is always ‘capable of being born alive’ with AWT. Therefore, women would have no time to reflect on the reasons (financial or otherwise) for which they may seek an abortion (after previously having twenty-four weeks) before abortion is criminalised under the IL(P)A.  With over 99% of abortions taking place within the limits set by the current AA 1967 twenty-four week viability threshold,37 this would substantially limit access to abortion.   Appropriately, this may be averse to fetal interests as well, as mandating a woman to give birth on account of viability regardless of her reasons for seeking abortion could have negative effects on the quality of the child’s upbringing.   If AWT becomes an admissible factor of viability in a judicial context, it will criminalise a substantial amount of abortions, for the reasons stated above. This could represent a shift in the law of abortion, from being rooted in feminist theory, to having a pro-life stance, and is a further reason that a solution must be obtained to address the pending legal concerns of AWT. This may be obviated should AWT be inadmissible as evidence of viability, and this idea will be developed further in this paper. IV(b). The socioeconomic implications of limited access to abortionAs it has been identified, the current application of viability in the context of AWT will become obsolete, and its retention may substantially limit access to abortion. Therefore, AWT is far from settling the abortion debate. Accordingly, Schultz believes that in the U. S. , where some States are hostile towards abortion, the expedition of viability may give them an opportunity to “dramatically limit abortion” under its current application. 38 Whilst there is no evidence that the UK will intentionally act in the same way, it is necessary to address the implications of limiting abortion. The law desires a balance between maternal and fetal interest. However, with AWT, the balance would tip towards the fetus, which not only comprises issues of autonomy, but other socioeconomic factors. Women seek abortions for a variety of reasons: For example, a study identified that 40% of women (the highest portion) sought abortion for financial reasons. 39 If a woman without the means to raise a child is denied abortion as a result of AWT’s expediated viability, “implications for the well-being of their offspring” may arise,40 such as financial hardship during childhood, development issues caused by a lack of parental affection and more. 41 Although a common counter-argument is that women desiring abortion would have the option to gestate ex-utero for adoption, a woman may actually seek abortion to avoid genetic motherhood and “rid herself of the burden” of knowing she has an existing child. 42 It is also strange that whilst AWT will affect the theoretical viability of the fetus and have the effect of limiting abortion access, many women would not have the financial means to access AWT. Thus, the limit they may face to abortion access is based upon an unachievable standard of viability.   Another important point is that abortions will occur unsafely if they are unduly limited.  43 This will undoubtedly lead to a lot of expense in treating complications from unsafe abortion, which is estimated to affect around 20-50% of women who have one. 44 Clearly then, the law must change to attempt to reconcile the balance of maternal/fetal rights in the face of an endangered viability doctrine. However, if a meaningful viability mechanism cannot be retained, this balance becomes extremely difficult and the law will most likely tilt to either a feminist or pro-life stance.   IV(c). The legal status of fetusesIt is a well-established common law principle that legal personhood is crystallised at birth. 45 Therefore, the right to life under Article 2 of the ECHR does not extend to a fetus;46 an interpretation not without contention. For example, Judge Mularoni’s dissent in Vo v France 47 asserted that a lack of personhood should not disqualify all recognition and protection for the fetus’ right to life. 48 She draws upon the Oviedo Convention to substantiate her point, which regulates the use of potential prenatal genetic modifications and wider misuse of biotechnology in order to protect the interests and dignity “of everyone, including the unborn”. 49 This suggests that the unborn does not necessarily lack protections associated with a right to life. Her argument is convincing, as it highlights that there is a propensity to ‘cherry-pick’ when the unborn is protected, e. g. not against abortion but against the misuse of biotechnology.   Nevertheless, a distinction should be made that in an abortion context, a conflict of rights would arise were the fetus given a right to life against the mother’s autonomy. Meanwhile, in terms of the protection that Oviedo supplies (against biotechnological abuse), there is no clash of rights between the unborn and any immediate person.   Accordingly, if a fetus were to be given legal personhood, the right to abortion could be sidestepped completely. Despite this, Romanis has correctly identified that if a fetus is extracted from the womb to be placed into an artificial womb, it has been born by the definition of birth under Section 41 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, which is “a child born alive”. 50 As a fetus placed into ectogenesis will not be dead, this definition will have been fulfilled, possibly affording it legal personhood. This would be the first instance in which a gestating fetus would have personhood under the law. Some believe that this is justified, as Colgrove asserts that fetuses taken from the womb to be placed within ectogenesis “are newborns (although very young ones)”. 51 Nevertheless, to give personhood to a fetus being placed into AWT would eliminate the mother’s ability to terminate the pregnancy without committing infanticide. This poses the question as to whether a woman’s autonomy and choice to abort should extend to when the fetus is no longer the subject of her womb, which seems foreign to the ‘my body, my choice’ doctrine. Nevertheless, as discussed, abortion is mainly sought for reasons that have nothing to do with the woman’s body, but instead her circumstances. Therefore, to afford legal personality to the subject of ectogenesis would reject this and subvert the temporal balance in law between the maternal/fetal rights and risk the fetal interests outweighing the mother’s.   Therefore, it is advisable that Parliament should address the definition of birth to make sure it cannot afford personhood to fetuses being placed into ectogenesis. A definition should classify AWT as merely an extension of the womb, unlike regular incubation, so birth cannot occur until a fetus is alive outside of the womb or any device acting as such.   V. Looking Forward: Defining AWT as the Female WombClearly, the many implications of AWT threaten viability, and destabilise the maternal/fetal balance. At first glance, the concept of viability will simply cease to be compatible with the context of abortion law once AWT is available. With viability from any stage of pregnancy, it is no longer a question, and so can no longer be a meaningful tool to balance the interest of the fetus against that of the mother. Consequently, without a meaningful standard of viability, the law must evidently shift to either retain the mother’s right to abortion (to avoid complete criminalisation of abortion) and eliminate the interests of the viable fetus, or vice versa.   However, this article suggests a re-conception of the viability threshold. The law generally aims to balance maternal/fetal interests through the viability standard. 52In the U. S. , where abortion is deemed a constitutional right, landmark decisions such as Roe v Wade,53 Planned Parenthood v Casey54 and Gonzales v Carhart55 highlight the importance of viability as a tool to maintain the maternal/fetal balance. The viability thresholds in English law observed in the Abortion Act and IL(P)A are just further proof of the integration of the viability doctrine within abortion jurisprudence. Therefore, retaining the doctrine of viability would be the most legally desirable outcome. Hence, Parliament should anticipatorily elect to not differentiate an artificial womb from a natural womb. This could be achieved by the insertion of a statutory provision into the Acts governing abortion, the AA 1967 and the IL(P)A 1929. Such a provision would classify AWT as the natural womb, or an extension thereof. Accordingly, there would be no differentiation in terms of the law of abortion between the wombs, and AWT could not be considered as a factor in viability. Following this approach, fetal viability would be judged against its chance of survival if it were to be removed from ectogenesis.   This would allow for the retention of viability, along with the statutory thresholds of the Abortion Act and IL(P)A. In essence, this approach would maintain the status quo and the manner in which abortion law is currently applied. Some may argue that this would be a missed opportunity to reform the law under a complete feminist stance, which would consolidate abortion as an absolute and unlimited right. Yet with only 0. 1% of terminations taking place after the twenty-four week threshold in England and Wales in 2018,56 and 80% occurring before even 10 weeks,57 changing the law in a feminist direction and destabilising the sacred balance of interests would only make a trivial difference compared to upholding the viability doctrine via the proposed solution. In practice, the likelihood of late abortion based upon choice, and not necessity, is hypothetical, and such an approach would not have a detrimental effect on the pro-choice campaign. VI. ConclusionTo conclude, AWT poses some dilemmas for the future, and will deem current legislative thresholds on viability obsolete. An analysis of the right to abortion has characterised it as evolving into a widely recognised right, and thus Parliament should act quickly on the ways to reconcile the relationship between AWT and abortion. Furthermore, if the laws are not amended, the viability doctrine will become ephemeral under AWT and will pose grave implications to women’s autonomy and access to abortion, including its criminalisation thereof. Furthermore, whilst it is deemed legally desirable to balance the interests of the mother and the fetus, such a balance will be unable to be founded upon viability if AWT is deemed to be a factor thereof, and the concept will become superfluous. Therefore, to restore the balance, Parliament should consider approaches to AWT which retain the viability doctrine, which many argue is irreplaceable. 58 This paper has suggested that the most simplistic approach to this is for a statutory provision to clarify that an artificial womb is to be treated no differently as the mother’s womb. Therefore, the AWT is not to be considered a factor of viability.

    "title": "Building the Conscience of Humankind: An Analysis of the Use of Selective Imagery on the 75th Anniversary of International Criminal Justice",
    "body": "2021/03/23 - AbstractThe past November marked the 75th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg Trials, a milestone that the Tokyo Trial will in turn reach next May. These two proceedings instituted the long-awaited birth of international criminal justice, after the frustrated trial of Kaiser Wilhelm II following the Great War and the Treaty of Versailles. From the very outset, images played a fundamental role in shaping international criminal justice before its audience. This article analyses how the use of visual elements (i. e. , the depiction of victim suffering) has been instrumental in driving international criminal justice – and, therefore, law – in certain directions, whereas censorship (i. e. , the depiction of victimlessness) has contributed to the avoidance of undesired paths. I argue that this manipulation through image has been utilised to build a conscience of humankind and thus achieve greater legitimacy of international criminal law in its inaugural trials, while attempting to conceal one of the greatest pitfalls of the field: selectivity. IntroductionThe trials of Nuremberg and Tokyo in 1945/1946 set in motion a system that, albeit with significant hiatuses, has been running for 75 years: international criminal justice. Even though these were two (obviously) distinct legal proceedings, Gerry Simpson has coined the term ‘Tokyoberg’ to refer to the twinned trials,1 which can be analysed as a single event where multiple revolutions occurred in the way we understand, and articulate, concepts such as individual responsibility, the criminalisation of war, and the invention of crimes against humanity. 2 I will make use of the Tokyobergian idea throughout the essay. In the late 1990s, international legal scholars conceptualised how international criminal justice, despite the contentions for its universality, had in fact been highly selective. McCormack asserted that selectivity is first found in relation to the acts the international community characterises as crimes and, secondly, in relation to the particular alleged atrocities that international criminal justice collectively prosecutes. 3 Simpson argued that a fundamental requirement of the rule of law is generality, and therefore the selective application of international criminal law entails a serious flaw in the international legal system itself and an impediment to the just application of these laws. 4 Bothe identified that states are very cautious when creating law enforcement mechanisms that could potentially assert jurisdiction over their nationals, while conversely applying much wider views of liability in ‘safe’ frameworks (i. e. , in situations where the exercise of jurisdiction over their own nationals is unlikely). 5 Fast forward to the 2010s – now with a permanent International Criminal Court operating for some years – a group of scholars studied a phenomenon which, as they found, had been instrumental in developing international criminal law: the utilisation of images. Schwöbel-Patel observed that international criminal tribunals, probably more than any other international institutions, have relied on videos and other forms of images to narrate their purpose and showcase the discipline of international criminal law and its main protagonists. 6 Tallgren remarked that there is a relationship between images of suffering from ‘atrocity’ and the desired support for international criminal justice: seeking empathy and commitment to action by images is a frequent practice of humanitarianism and international criminal law gives special attention to victimhood. 7 As she puts it, ‘images and international criminal justice make an enigmatic couple’. 8 The purpose of this essay is to combine the concepts of selectivity and imagery, by analysing the ways in which they intertwined in the emergence of international criminal justice. Today, 75 years after Tokyoberg, international criminal law still finds itself struggling to enhance its legitimacy by resorting to representational narratives9 – a technique that goes back a long way. I do not intend to add to the criticism about the great, routine failures of the field, or, as it was recently construed, become another ‘pragmatist pointing out the obvious defects in the system’. 10 Rather, this essay will trace back to the origins of international criminal justice to focus on how visual elements were utilised or discarded in Tokyoberg to exploit audiences and masquerade the well-known selectivity. The result, I argue, is the engineered dichotomic portrayal of, either, deeply tormented victims, or no victims at all. ‘The Conscience of Humankind’: Legalism Through ImageryNouwen and Werner illustrate that when an international criminal court is involved, the primary concern becomes ‘convincing the international community that justice is done’; that is, that the form of justice preferred by the international community is done. 11 Contrasted with the notion of ‘global justice’, other conceptions of law appear as particular, local and traditional. 12 Therefore, one of the objectives of international criminal law is to monopolise the prevailing discourses of such global justice. 13 In Tokyoberg, this pursuit was evident. Hartley Shawcross, Chief British prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, argued that ‘international law has in the past made some claim that there is a limit to the omnipotence of the state and that the individual … is not disentitled to the protection of mankind when the state tramples upon his rights in a manner which outrages the conscience of mankind. ’14 In a similar vein, Telford Taylor, the American lawyer who acted as Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg, addressed the judges by saying: ‘… we are not now indicting the German General Staff at the bar of history, but on specific charges of crimes against international law and the dictates of the conscience of mankind, as embodied in the Charter which governs this Court. ’15 The phrasing ‘conscience of mankind’ had originated at Versailles and re-emerged years later to underpin the effective kick-off of the international criminal justice system. 16 This effort to construct a global justice to foster the protection of an overarching moral humanity earned, on the one hand, the praise of the philosopher Karl Jaspers – who saw the trials as a possibility to reorient Germany to the tradition of humanism as well as a renewal of the tradition of Western humanism itself for a cosmopolitan future – and, on the other, the mistrust of Hannah Arendt – who thought the social construction of moral or criminal guilt would exonerate not only Germans but humanity from the need for a more profound ethical and political response. 17 The narratives behind international criminal justice attempted to offset the weaknesses of the system (such as the concerns about victors’ justice and ex post facto criminal law) by appealing to the moral conscience of humanity, an allegedly global-shared value which was so superior, so intrinsic to the human being, that its damage could not be tolerated. This principle stemmed from the recognition of the supremacy of the law of humanity over the law of a sovereign state when it violates elementary human rights; particularly in a manner which may justly be held to shock the conscience of humankind. 18 Consequently, the merged notions of ‘conscience’ and ‘humankind’ offered a creative way out of the predicaments of inexistent positive criminal law, and thus became the legal basis buttressing legality in Tokyoberg. In parallel, victims became fundamental to reinforcing the theory of a damaged conscience and its need for redress. Invoking victimhood generally comes with a claim to authority, a claim that one is entitled to speak on behalf of the category of the actual victims, and on behalf of the abstract victim (i. e. , humankind). 19 This authority is also a claim to ‘authorship’, namely the power to write the story – and history – of victims in a particular way. 20 Against this background, imagery played a crucial role in the development of monopolistic legitimising discourses. Photographs and videos of victims have been used in international criminal justice to draw attention to selected acts that must shock the conscience of humankind, whereas other visuals have been deliberately concealed to sterilise the shocking capacity of the acts that they portrayed. The power culminates in shaping the focus: some suffering gets selected, passes through the elaborate international criminal justice procedural rites, is purified, and becomes confirmed as worthy of concern. 21 Through this theoretical lens, the following sections examine the exhibition/concealment of imagery in the aftermath of the Second World War. II. Conscience and the Imagery of Atrocity in TokyobergThe Allied powers were in need to forward the concept of global justice for the legitimacy of the trials. The task came not without dangers: the ghosts of ex post facto law and ad hocery, in addition to the sceptical – now contradictory – views that many Allies had had towards trying the Kaiser, threatened the success of the project. Versailles had been surrounded by a certain aversion to resorting to a law-rooted legitimacy for William II’s trial, to the extent that Article 227 included all kinds of euphemisms for ‘law’, but never the exact word. In this vein, Clemenceau wrote in 1920 that this “was not a case of a public accusation fundamentally of a legal character, but of an act of high international policy demanded by the conscience of mankind”. 22 In Tokyoberg, 25 years later, the legalistic approach attained much more preponderance. As Simpson contends, ‘Roosevelt was worrying about acquittals on technicalities and Robert Jackson – pressed on the existence of crimes against humanity or aggression – replied by saying “we can save ourselves from these pitfalls of definition if our test of what is a crime gives recognition to those things which fundamentally outrage the conscience of the American people. ” The victims of war crimes had become the people in general … This became at trial the idea of “shocking the conscience of mankind. ”23 The trial was understood as an exercise in the reconstitution of the law, an act staged not only to punish extreme crimes but to demonstrate the power of the law to submit the most horrific outrages to the hand of justice. 24 In this regard, the trial was to serve as a spectacle of legality, making visible both the crimes of the Germans and the neutral authority of the rule of law: the idiom of judgment on this point took the form of ‘crimes against humanity’. 25 The situation presented other hurdles for the United States as well. International criminal law was supposed to redress the egregious acts carried out by the Nazi and Japanese regimes, and the core legitimacy to try the perpetrators was contained in the shocking capacity of those deeds of moral turpitude. But how could the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, crimes equally capable of shocking consciences, be left out? The Americans were not the only ones facing these quandaries, as the British carried the burden of the carpet bombings of several German cities (causing more than 300,000 civilian deaths)26 and the Soviets faced responsibility for the terrible Katyn Massacre, among others. In this delicate scenario, the portrayal of images to audiences was meticulously designed. Which events to expose graphically, and which to hide, became a matter that the victor states carefully calculated in parallel to the Tokyobergian implementation. This exploitation was instrumental in perfecting the legalism that was needed as a pillar of the trials. Michalczyk presents a thorough review of the usage of visual elements before and during Nuremberg, where accounts in the form of both photographs and movies were broadcasted to a big portion of the world’s population, especially to those affected by the war. 27 In February 1945, some months after the first camps were liberated by the Soviets, a director working for the British Ministry of Information Film Division contacted the Allied Psychological Warfare Division in order to collect and produce material ‘with a view to preparing a film which will show the German atrocities in many parts of the world’. 28 By June, camps had also been discovered by the Allies advancing from the West. The Anglo-German newsreel ‘Welt im Film’ (‘The World on Film’) was released, explicitly depicting the atrocities in a series of graphic scenes from concentration camps. Its showcase became part of the denazification plan, encompassing the message ‘Dass ist Faschismus, dass ist Nationalsozialismus’ (‘That is Fascism, that is National Socialism’). 29 Screenings were made compulsory in Allied-occupied Germany. 30 In September 1945, Robert Jackson, Chief US Prosecutor at Nuremberg, personally reviewed a film called ‘That Justice Be Done’ (produced by the Office of Strategic Services and also translated to German) and believed that the short documentary would be a means of educating the public about the rationale for an international trial. Released in theatres in October, the film allowed Americans to view on screen the oppressive Nazi rule in the context of the ideals of the American system of justice. 31 The US Signal Corps were instructed to document extensively – and vividly – the results of the Nazi monstruous atrocities, producing photos and films that were designed to ‘document history as well as inform an incredulous world that lay unaware of the concentration camp nightmare. 32 Accordingly, the Soviets also did their part. During the trial they presented significant amounts of film evidence showing the civilians that had been massacred in various Nazi camps. The piles of corpses and emaciated prisoners were displayed explicitly. In the minds of the Soviets, the presentation of this footage of atrocities at Nuremberg would further assure that their victimhood at the hands of the Nazis would be viewed in an international forum. This compilation of four reels of material, lasting approximately one hour, screened for the Tribunal, included the newsreels and documentaries which had already been shown in Russian theatres. 33 The footage established an important narrative in which Soviet images of Nazi atrocities predominated, in addition to depictions of the triumphant marches of the Red Army. 34 Hicks reflects that ‘propaganda was inextricably entwined with atrocity; indeed, the latter would not have been shown without the former. 35 The Nuremberg trial spectacle included not only films and photographs of victims, but actual victims’ remains. ‘The shrunken head of Buchenwald’ – a fist-sized human head with the skull bone removed, stuffed, and preserved – was exhibited in the courtroom as vivid proof of the barbarous Nazi experiments. The scholar Lawrence Douglas has analysed the prosecution’s rhetoric around the shrunken head, in connection to the legalistic discourse that acted as bedrock to the ‘crimes against humanity’ limb of the accusation. The cranium, Douglas concludes, served as the most tangible representation of Nazi crimes as atavistic: an unquestionable testimony that the acts performed at the camps belonged to an era that predated civilisation. 36 Therefore, law was meant to act as the protector of a civilised humankind. In Robert Jackson’s words: ‘If we cannot eliminate the causes and prevent the repetition of these barbaric events, it is not an irresponsible prophecy to say that this twentieth century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization. ’37 Photos of the shrunken head became some of the best-known images associated with the trial. 38 The fact that great part of the visual testimonies was not only used at the trials, but also broadcasted to the general population, speaks significantly about the intention that underlay the juridical necessity of presenting evidence that could not only contribute to the criminal conviction of the accused, but also outrage the civilised conscience. Schwöbel-Patel’s theory on spectacle in international criminal law is an applicable framework to reflect the logic behind Tokyoberg: ‘Understanding victims of international crime as spectacularized directs attention to the visual and rhetorical signification of the social construction of victimhood … and more broadly to the understanding of international criminality and its apparent antithesis of humanitarianism. ’39 The creation of images – and their timely distribution – became part of the legitimising machinery claiming for justice to be done in Tokyoberg. III. ‘The Mushroom Cloud’: Censorship in Occupied JapanOn the other hand, Tokyoberg worked to erase (or, worse, instrumentalise) the atomic bombings Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Until the United States ceased the Japanese occupation in 1952, no photographs or videos portraying the damage caused to civilians were released. One of the earliest accounts on selectivity applied in international criminal justice belongs to Justice Pal in his famous dissent at Tokyo. He was outraged by the concept of trying leaders for crimes of which the prosecutors were themselves guilty: the decision of the American government to drop nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was, in his assessment, a clear example of a crime against humanity. 40 Cryer praises Pal’s exposition for identifying this primeval bias in international criminal justice,41 which contrasted with the widespread notion that Tokyoberg should be regarded as the beginning of a new era of accountability, a milestone in the fight against the impunity of those who shock the conscience of humankind. 42 In addition, Justice Pal stated: ‘his decision to use the atom bomb is the only near approach to the directives of the German emperor during the first world war and of the Nazi leaders during the second world war. Nothing like this could be traced to the credit of the accused. ’43 Pal’s dissenting opinion was not read at the trial and it was not published in Japan after the American occupation was finished. The use of atomic weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not awaken what some hoped would ‘bring about a unity of humanity, linked to all our fellow human beings, irrespective of race, creed, or color, by bonds which have been fused unbreakably in the diabolical heat of these explosions’. 44 In the end, Justice Pal concluded, there was no justification for these inhuman blasts. 45 In the same vein, one of the Japanese members of the defence counsel, Okamoto Shoichi,46 strived to bring justice to the victims of the bombings: he was convinced that indiscriminate attacks on civilians with atomic bombs clearly constituted war crimes that should not have gone unnoticed in the Tokyo Trial. 47 However, the lack of consideration of the atrociousness of the atomic bombings at the trial received surprisingly meagre commentaries outside of Pal’s and Shoichi’s. As Polunina highlights, even the Soviets – who had complained about many failures of the proceedings – remained remarkably reserved about Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the trial and in their home press. 48 The United States carefully engineered a strict censorship mechanism which was in force during most times of the American occupation, and even when there were brief periods of press freedom, reporting on atomic damage was basically done through eyewitness accounts and scarce scientific evidence. 49 A special unit was created: the ‘Publications, Pictorial and Broadcast Section’. 50 It issued a ‘Manual on Censorship in Japan’ directed to the censors, in which they were told that their primary mission was to ensure that the efforts of Japan to emerge from its defeat as a new nation, entitled to a place among the peace-loving nations of the world, would not be harmed. 51 In January 1946, the motion picture industry in Japan was informed that no film could be shown without prior clearance by the censors, including simple paper movies shown by itinerant storytellers. 52 Even those who owned films had to make detailed reports of them. 53 Alongside the endeavours to conceal the horrifying effects of the bombings, the manipulation of photographs and videos was intended to portray an image of Japan’s war guilt, both inside Japan and to the rest of the world. Even prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, imagery had been utilised for the stigmatisation of the Japanese regime within the Western collective imagination. When the Japanese army attacked Shanghai in the summer of 1937, the photographer H. S. Wong, working for an American agency, captured the image of a Chinese baby covered in blood, crying desperately, surrounded by destroyed railway tracks. Wong would later recall that the baby’s mother lay dead some meters away from him. 54 The picture, titled ‘Bloody Saturday’, was sent to New York and featured in Hearst newsreels, newspapers and life magazine—the widest audience a picture could then have. 55 Viewed by more than 136 million people, it struck a personal chord that transcended ethnicity and geography: to many, the infant’s pain represented Japan’s bloodlust. 56 The photograph is now included in TIME’s magazine ‘Most Influential Images of All Time’. TIME’s collection contains, as well, a depiction of the drop of the atomic bomb. When the 20-kiloton weapon hit Nagasaki, approximately 80 thousand people died instantly. However, the iconic photograph shows no humans, but a massive cloud of radioactive debris, as it was taken by Lieutenant Charles Levy from the US observation aircraft named, paradoxically, ‘The Great Artiste’. According to TIME, ‘Officials censored photos of the bomb’s devastation, but Levy’s image … was circulated widely. The effect shaped American opinion in favor of the nuclear bomb, leading the nation to celebrate the atomic age. ’57 The sanitised depersonalisation of the bombings was rigorously devised and presented as nothing but military progress against the bellicose enemy. Perhaps the quote by Benjamin Wright, a historian at UT Texas who recently contributed to curate a book containing Japanese photographs of the bombed cities and populations, can illustrate a sentiment that still lingers: ‘Americans, when they think about atomic war, think about the mushroom cloud. ’58 ConclusionKendall and Nouwen argue that international criminal justice operates in the representation of victims in two ways: through their participation in trials, and through the discursive invocation of abstract victimhood. 59 The latter, which transcends all actual victims and corresponds to no individual victims in their particularity, becomes a figure of victimhood that is deployed as a kind of new sovereign of international criminal law. 60 The aesthetics of this victimhood, coming back to the notion of spectacle in international criminal law, are presented to the audience in the most colourful and dramatic way possible. 61 The narratives around Tokyoberg were constructed to invoke the sentiments of the international community towards the pressing need to punish those who had outraged the conscience of humankind. In that effort, a massive display of imagery was presented to the different audiences around the world, which were juridically and sensorially summoned to integrate the morality of international law and claim for justice. For this purpose, the vivid construction of victimhood was paramount. However, Tokyoberg also represents the dialectic dyad of victimhood versus victimlessness. These two contrasting concepts encompassed the building of a conscience of humankind that was carefully produced and discursively engineered to consolidate a juridical humanity 75 years ago. In the prevailing discourse, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atrocities were sterilised: they became the mushroom clouds, the deserved response to a war-guilty nation, the effort to bring war to an end. Unseen were the images of humans suffering, and intact remained the assembled conscience of humankind. The hibakusha victimhood belongs to the ‘missing scenes’ of the Tokyoberg movie. In its place: the dehumanised victimlessness. 62 Kevin Gerenni The author would like to thank the LSE Law Review and Professor Gerry Simpson for the stimulating discussions that triggered this piece.

    "body": "2021/03/12 - Abstract:: This article analyses the European Court of Human Rights’ use of the concepts of ‘European consensus’ and ‘margin of appreciation’ in light of their effects on minority rights. Normative justifications and objections to the Court’s use of the doctrines are outlined. Through an exploration of the Court’s jurisprudence on minority rights within the European Convention on Human Rights framework, the article illustrates that the Court’s opaque approach to its use of the doctrines can lead to a dilution of the protection of minority rights. The article concludes that it will thus be crucial for the Court to provide safeguards for any future use of these interpretive tools in cases where minority rights are at stake. Introduction: This article embarks on a critical discussion of the European Court of Human Rights’ (“ECtHR”) use of European consensus (“EuC”) and the margin of appreciation (“MoA”) in light of its effect on minority rights. The two concepts are firstly defined and situated in context. Thereafter, normative justifications and objections to the use of EuC in determining the width of the MoA are outlined. The article does not provide a thorough review of the Court’s general case law on minority rights. Rather, it highlights a lack of clarity in the Court’s application of EuC and MoA and the consequences flowing from this. This is illustrated through a line of cases regarding the rights of transgender persons, Roma children and Muslim women. The article concludes that while there is some value in the ECtHR’s current approach, it will nonetheless be important for the Court to develop a consistent and rigorous methodology for the application of the doctrines in cases regarding minority rights. This is crucial for the Court to maintain its role as guardian of the European human rights regime. The Contours of the Interpretive Tools: The MoA refers to “the room for manoeuvre Strasbourg institutions are prepared to accord national authorities in fulfilling their obligations” under the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”). 1 The EuC refers to “the level of uniformity present in the legal frameworks of the member States of the Council of Europe on a particular topic”. 2 The Court uses EuC to justify a wide MoA afforded to Member States in the absence of consensus, and advance new standards where there is a clear trend present across Member States. The tools are mostly used at the third stage of review of qualified rights – following the first two stages, which require any interference with qualified rights to be prescribed by law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. A key question at the third stage is the degree of deference the Court ought to afford states in determining whether a particular interference with a right is necessary in a democratic society to protect the legitimate aims listed in the ECHR. In general, where there is a lack of an EuC, the Court will afford a broader MoA to Member States, and vice versa. Further, the scope of the MoA afforded directly relates to the strictness of review: the wider the margin, the less strict the scrutiny by the Court, and vice versa. 3 Thus, the existence of an EuC is the determining factor for the Court when defining the scope of the MoA. 4 The Normative Foundation: The question to be addressed at the outset is whether the Court’s use of an EuC to determine the width of the MoA can be normatively justified. A central role of the ECtHR is to correct injustices perpetrated by the majority against minorities. 5 Indeed, the Court has declared that part of its mandate is to protect individuals from infringements of Convention rights “grounded upon a predisposed bias on the part of a […] majority against a […] minority”. 6 This invites the question of which interpretive tools are appropriate to employ in fulfilling this mandate. In evaluating whether EuC is an appropriate tool, two competing elements are emphasised: firstly, the importance of the expansion of the protection traditionally afforded under a Convention right by the Court to vulnerable minority groups, and secondly, the recognition that the impact of such a progressive interpretation is grounded in the Court’s legitimacy vis-à-vis Member States. Objections to EuC stem from the Court’s mandate of safeguarding minority rights. Minorities are often barred from equal participation in the democratic process domestically – it is therefore important for the ECtHR to serve as a “countermajoritarian check”. 7 Critics have highlighted the inherent contradiction in the ECtHR resorting to a quantitative exercise in determining the EuC, particularly where the applicant belongs to a minority group. 8 In light of the Court’s mandate, reliance on EuC seems “counterintuitive, if not problematic, when determining the rights of unpopular social groups and minorities”. 9 The Court must exercise caution in applying the doctrines in the context of minority rights. Lodging a complaint to the ECtHR can be the only recourse to justice a minority has when the rights of its members are not protected domestically. Indeed, affording states a wide MoA on the basis of a lack of a uniform approach might deprive a minority of human rights protection, since the institution established to promote their rights will be relying on the same majoritarian bias that the group is seeking to reverse. For groups that have experienced widespread, systemic abuses of their rights, the EuC seems to be a counterproductive tool to determine their rights. In defence of the doctrine, it is argued that the use of EuC is justified, as it aids the Court in preserving its legitimacy. The Court operates under the principle of subsidiarity, which “determines its role as secondary to […] national legal orders […] that have the primary responsibility of implementing and interpreting the Convention”. 10 A state in disagreement of a judgment can, in principle, choose not to renew the right of individual petition, withdraw from the Convention, or express its discontent through failing to or delaying its compliance with a judgment. The Court is faced with a difficult task: it must reverse rights-abusive practices of Contracting States whilst preserving its legitimacy. 11 With the surge of criticism that the Court “has frequently exceeded its mandate”,12 consensus-based interpretation can provide a means to legitimise the Court’s judgments and ensure their enforcement. 13 For the Court to guard the European human rights regime, its legitimacy must be preserved. Otherwise, the Court’s decisions will have a limited practical effect within domestic legal systems and the substantive protection of human rights will effectively be removed. Finally, the use of EuC in determining the scope of the MoA has been justified on the basis that the Court can rely on the doctrines to interpret the Convention progressively and strengthen minority rights. As contended by Tzevelekos and Dzehtsiarou, when minority rights are at stake in a given case, the Court has a compelling justification to use the tools with greater flexibility and enhance the protection of minority rights. 14 Such an approach can render the tools normatively compatible with the two competing accounts on the role of EuC in minority rights cases. However, as it is more likely that a consensus exists against a minority when examining minority rights under the lens of EuC, the danger exists that the Court’s application of the tools can stifle minority rights. It is therefore pertinent that the Court adopts this approach – namely, relying on the doctrines to strengthen minority rights – uniformly across cases concerning minority groups. The Court’s Approach: Opaque or Clear?: To illustrate the Court’s approach to EuC and MoA, the article focuses on application of the doctrines in cases concerning three minority groups where the Court has adopted substantively different approaches: the rights of transgender persons, Roma children, and Muslim women. The Court’s opaque approach can be illustrated in a line of cases concerning the rights of transgender persons. The line begins with Rees, 15 regarding the legal recognition of the sexual identity of post-operative transsexual individuals. The Court found that an EuC was not present, as there was “little common ground between the Contracting States in this area and that […] the law appear[ed] to be in a transitional state”. 16 Consequently, the Court afforded the state a wide MoA. 17 The Court recognised the severity of the consequences caused by a lack of legal recognition of this group of persons’ identity. 18Despite this, the Court held that the lack of an EuC outweighed the interest in applying strict review of the State’s infringement of their rights under Article 8. The Court, however, warned states to keep this area of the law “under review”19 and adapt their legislation accordingly. In the cases of Cossey 20 and Sheffield,21 the Court reaffirmed its position in Rees. The majority found that developments in the legislation of Member States was not enough for the Court to determine that an EuC was now present. 22 While this was in line with its reasoning in Rees, the Court failed to signal what specifically within the field the states ought to keep under review to update legislation in line with the Convention. The dissenting opinion of Judge Martiens reveals a disagreement between the judges on this point. Judge Martiens found that the existence of an EuC on the matter was strongly reinforced by the increased consensus from five to fourteen Contracting States, along with supporting resolutions by “the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament recommending that reclassification of the sex of a post-operative transsexual be made legally possible”. 23 The disagreement between judges highlights the lack of a clear set of criteria for the determination of EuC. This lack of clarity resulted in the Court widening the MoA and refraining from applying strict review to strengthen this category of persons’ rights. The turning point in the case law was Goodwin,24 where the Court officially narrowed the MoA for Member States on the legal recognition of the sexual identity of post-operative transsexual individuals. The determining factor was, once again, EuC. The Court found that there was still a lack of “a common European approach”. 25 Despite this being the main factor preventing the Court from taking a step forward in the protection of transgender rights in the aforementioned cases, the Court turned its approach on its head. The Court attached “less importance to the lack of” an EuC “than to the clear and uncontested evidence of a continuing international trend in favour not only of increased social acceptance of transsexuals but of legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals”. 26 It is clear that the Court has neither developed, nor is bound by, any strict criteria in applying the doctrines. The breakthrough of the Goodwin judgement does not mark the end of the saga. As confirmed in Goodwin: while the Court found that EuC existed regarding the legal recognition of the new sexual identity of post-operative transsexuals, the Court did not find that EuC was present regarding states’ determination of the conditions to such recognition. 27 Requirements set out by states for legal recognition varied and most of these criteria were criticised, including for undermining individual autonomy. 28 In A. P. , Garçon,29 the Court examined the compatibility of the ECHR requirements for gender recognition of an “irreversible change in appearance”, interpreted as compulsory sterilisation,30 and the mandatory diagnosis of “gender identity disorder”. The Court found that a common approach was not present on the subject, as states were divided regarding the sterility requirement. 31 Nevertheless, the Court relied on a trend emerging in recent years towards abolishing the condition. 32 Despite the lack of a strong EuC on the subject, the Court found the trend to be a sufficient basis on which to narrow the MoA. The Court therefore employed strict review of the applicant’s rights and ruled that the compulsory sterilisation requirement violated the applicants’ Article 8 rights. 33 As mandatory sex reassignment surgery interferes with physical integrity to a similar extent as forced sterilisation, a logical next step in this evolution would have been to find such a requirement to violate Article 8 in the case of X v FYROM. 34 The requirement of mandatory sex reassignment bars transgender, genderfluid, non-binary and other genderqueer persons who choose not to or are unable to undergo sex reassignment surgery from gender recognition. In their dissenting opinion, judges Pejchal and Wojtyczek criticised the judgement of Garçon for finding that a ‘trend’ was sufficient to narrow the MoA. They argued that such an analysis was a typical sign of “judicial activism”. 35 Because of the disagreements within the Court on the proper application of EuC, the Court “refused to examine the applicant’s claim that mandatory sex reassignment surgery as a requirement for gender recognition […] violated Article 8”. 36 The Court in Goodwin identified three hallmarks of proper decision-making, all vital to uphold the rule of law: “legal certainty, foreseeability and equality”. 37 Ironically, the Court’s approach to the application of the doctrines violates all three. Throughout the ECtHR’s jurisprudence on transgender rights, the Court has failed to sufficiently determine the scope and proper application of EuC despite the vital role this tool has played. Lack of legal certainty and foreseeability flows from this. Disagreements about EuC resulted in “the Court’s reluctance to directly address pathologizing conditions for legal gender recognition”,38 thus aggravating existing vulnerabilities of this minority group. The Court’s Opaque Approach: Strengthening or Diluting Minority Rights?: Does the Court’s opaque approach to EuC undermine or reinforce the Court’s ability to enforce the protection of minority rights? Philosophers from Aristotle to Hart have recognized that all systems of law must negotiate a fundamental tension between legal certainty and flexibility. 39 The Court’s lack of a clear methodology in its application of EuC has enabled the Court to employ the doctrine with full flexibility. 40 Dzehtsiarou argues that the Court is aware of the limitations to their use of the doctrine, and that where minority rights are at stake, the Court has convincing justification to use the tool with greater flexibility or lessen the weight placed on it. 41 Flexibility can allow the Court to take progressive steps for minority rights, even in situations where an EuC is not conclusively present. The flexibility of the doctrines has indeed enabled the Court to rely on EuC to determine the applicants’ minority status to narrow the MoA of states and consequently enhance their protection under the Convention. This can be illustrated through the case of Oršuš. 42 The application concerned Roma children’s right to education. 43 Roma children were placed in separate classes in Croatia on account of their lack of proficiency in Croatian language. The Courtnoted an emerging consensus amongst Member States recognising the “special needs of minorities and an obligation to protect their security, identity and lifestyle”. 44 The Court relied on EuC to determine the status of the applicants as members of a minority group. This enabled the Court to narrow the MoA and exercise intense scrutiny of the measure. The flexibility of the tool allowed “the Court space for manoeuvre”45 in its application of EuC, and to strengthen the rights of a vulnerable minority group. However, the lack of a clear approach in the application of EuC in cases regarding minority rights has stripped the Court of the necessary constraints in its application of the doctrines in this realm. As illustrated by the case of SAS,46 EuC has been used to the detriment of minority rights without sufficient justification. The case concerned a French blanket ban prohibiting the covering of one’s face in public. The Court recognised that the measure interfered with the rights of a minority group, namely “Muslim women who choose to manifest their religion through wearing religious attire”. 47 The Court noted that, “from a strictly normative standpoint”,48 France was in a minority position in Europe as few Member States had imposed such a blanket ban. However, the Court found that because such a blanket ban had been the subject of debate in some Member States, which was proof of a lack of an EuC against the ban,49 and France was afforded a wide MoA. 50 As noted by the dissenting opinion, “it is difficult to understand why the majority [were] not prepared to accept the existence” of an EuC against the ban,51 when “an overwhelming majority, [had] not deemed it necessary to legislate in this area”, and thus “a very strong indicator for a European consensus” against the ban existed. 52In contrast to its reasoning in the Oršuš case, the Court did not rely on the EuC to invite closer scrutiny in light of the applicant’s minority status. Rather, the determination of EuC formed part of the foundation on which the Court held that the ban was proportionate to the aim pursued, rendering it necessary in a democratic society, and thus that the interference with this minority group’s rights was justified. 53 It is clear that the danger exists that the flexibility of the tool can weaken the Court’s ability to protect minority groups from discriminatory, majoritarian measures of Member States. Safeguards for the Future of the European Human Rights Regime: The Brighton Declaration,54 today reflected in the 2018 Copenhagen Declaration 55 and Protocol 15, which enshrines subsidiarity and the MoA in the preamble of the ECHR, signals that the “centre of gravity of the Convention system” will “be lower than it is today, closer temporally and spatially to all Europeans”. 56 It is clear that EuC and the MoA will play a vital role for the future of the ECtHR in shifting the focus to a “shared responsibility”. 57 It is therefore important to provide safeguards to the future use of these tools. Against a backdrop of the rising threats of climate change, nuclear weapons and the COVID-19 pandemic, one does not have to imagine a consensus or trend developing in Europe where personal liberties are restricted in the interests of national security or public safety and health. It is therefore crucial that the advancement of minority rights in the Court’s jurisprudence is not “inextricably linked to majoritarian consent expressed through EuC” and that infringements of rights are rigorously scrutinised by the Court. 58 The failure to articulate with precision the scope and function of EuC poses a potentially grave threat to the ECtHR’s role as the arbiter of European human rights, particularly of minorities. The time has come to develop a consistent and rigorous methodology for the application of EuC in cases regarding minority rights. If the Court accepts the need to narrow the MoA where minority rights are involved, a clearer test must be developed of the appropriate relationship between EuC and minority protection. This will ensure a consistent approach across cases regarding the rights of minority groups. Alternatively, where the Court departs from this approach, it must provide convincing analysis in its reasoning for the necessity of this. The Court must strive to develop clear, general principles for weighing the competing elements of the EuC and the MoA doctrines in cases where minority rights are at stake. Such safeguards must be in place to ensure that EuC is applied with careful consideration of minority rights across the Court’s jurisprudence. Conclusion: The string of cases regarding transgender rights is glaring proof of the Court’s opaque approach in applying the doctrines of EuC and MoA, underlined by the ongoing disagreement within the Court and the lack of constraint which the Court’s application of EuC in earlier cases proved to have on its approach in subsequent cases. This approach has enabled the Court to take progressive steps in the fight for minority rights, as illustrated by the cases of Goodwin, Garçon and Oršuš. However, the Court’s approach has also resulted in a dilution of minority rights, as illustrated in the cases of SAS and X v FYROM. The article recognises that the Court’s approach has enabled it to mitigate disagreements within the Court and navigate the tension between operating under the principle of subsidiarity and the role it has reserved for itself in securing the rights of marginalised groups. However, it is concluded that the Court must develop a clearer methodology to underpin its use of the doctrines in order to ensure that minority rights are strengthened rather than diluted. The appropriate application of the doctrines in cases regarding minority rights must be clearly defined and consistently adopted across the Court’s jurisprudence. Transparency, legal certainty and equity – key facets of the Court’s process legitimacy – are safeguards that must be kept in place. Only then can judges of the ECtHR “hold firm the compass of morality, guiding the communal ship towards more enlightened standards, [whilst] taking into account the prevailing winds and sea conditions”,59 and reinforce its crucial role in securing minority rights protection across Europe.

    "title": "Investor-State Dispute Settlement: Understanding the System's Legitimacy Crisis in Constitutional Terms",
    "body": "2021/02/18 - Abstract:: Investor-State Dispute Settlement is currently facing a legitimacy crisis which threatens to rattle the very foundations of the system. It is suggested this crisis can be divided in two: a procedural crisis, which can be addressed by reform, and a substantive crisis, which threatens the existence of the entire regime. This article focuses on the deeper substantive crisis caused by the problem of reverse discrimination. Specifically, it engages with constitutional terms of analysis to address the way in which reverse discrimination undermines national constitutional stability. It analyses exactly why the affront to constitutional stability is currently becoming particularly hard to bear for nation states. The conclusion is that the substantive legitimacy crisis faced by investment treaty law can only be addressed by a comprehensive repeal of the system. Introduction: The EU has failed to reach an agreement with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in large part because of its Investment Chapter: neither party could accept that foreign investors would be subject to a different set of rights than domestic companies. 1 It is patently clear that the legitimacy of Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) is currently under threat. 2 The first point is that the ISDS system currently faces two separate, but related, legitimacy crises. The first crisis, of procedural legitimacy, is strictly internal to the system – it stems from issues related to the way in which ISDS is dispensed. Importantly, these issues can be addressed by reform without significantly overhauling the system. The second, substantive legitimacy crisis, is exogenous to the workings of the system – it is rooted in the very logic of investment treaty law. The focus of this article is on this second, existential, challenge to the system. An insight will be provided into the issue of ‘reverse discrimination’, a practice through which foreign investors are able to use bilateral investment treaties (BITs) to obtain a different treatment than national companies. The existing literature on this topic describes the problems created by reverse discrimination in rather broad terms: reverse discrimination is accused of generally ‘undermining democratic accountability’ and ‘threatening legitimacy’. 3 The central purpose of the present article is to couch the issue of reverse discrimination in much more specific constitutional terms. As such, we will argue why the very logic of investment treaty law compromises constitutional commitments on the national level. We will also analyse why exactly this birth defect is now emerging as particularly unpalatable for sovereign states. This will lead to the unassailable conclusion that abandoning the ISDS system is necessary in order to protect national constitutional stability.   1.  Explaining the two aspects of the legitimacy crisis: It is widely understood that the ISDS system is currently plunged in a profound legitimacy crisis. 4 The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has formerly recognized this in asserting the pressing need for reform. 5 Its most recent Working Paper (2020) identified three proposals: (i) the potential introduction of a ‘stand-alone review or appellate mechanism’; (ii)  the creation of a ‘multilateral investment court’; and (iii) a fairer ‘selection and appointment of arbitrators and adjudicators’. 6 These proposals recognise that ISDS is undergoing a procedural legitimacy crisis, one which is strictly internal to the system. Their aim is therefore to reform ISDS from the inside. Importantly, the UNCITRAL diagnoses a strictly procedural crisis: they do not call for integral repeal of the system, but rather, seek to reform a number of its procedures.   Kelsey et al. note that a narrow focus on procedural issues carries the risk of ignoring the substantive challenges to the system – i. e. those which pose an existential threat to ISDS. 7 To a certain extent, it is not a surprise that UNCITRAL refuses to address substantive critiques of the system. Indeed, it is uniquely set up to look at the system from an internal perspective. The Guide to UNCITRAL published by the UNCITRAL secretariat states that part of the Commission’s mandate is to promote ’wider participation in existing international conventions and wider acceptance of existing model and uniform laws’. 8 As a reform body, it is engineered to consider only issues of procedure, without ever challenging the logic of ISDS itself.   Our contention is that a wider substantive legitimacy crisis dwarfs the narrow procedural crisis addressed by UNCITRAL. Specifically, the issue of reverse discrimination threatens to shake the constitutional foundations of sovereign states. The remainder of this article focuses on this broader, existential challenge, and explores why the system must therefore be overturned. 2.  The substantive aspect of the legitimacy crisis: how reverse discrimination threatens constitutional stability: a) How does ISDS entail reverse discrimination?Originally, the vast majority of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) were signed between a developed, capital-exporting country and a developing, capital-importing country. 9 As Jandhyala et. al note, during the first wave of BIT signings, ’the adoption of a BIT helped reassure foreign investors by offsetting weak and unstable domestic institutions in host countries. 10 Foreign investors would be encouraged to invest in developing countries, emboldened by the certainty that their investment would not be subjected to host country legal institutions, and therefore not expropriated or confiscated. 11 BITs were thus a way to hedge against political risk through law. Legally, these treaties were always reciprocal, but investment flows almost never came towards the developed country, which meant that policies in developed countries were very rarely challenged in investment arbitrations. As Mann demonstrates, the bilateral dimension of BITs was initially included only as a ceremonial recognition of the developing country’s sovereignty – in this sense, reciprocity was ’a matter of prestige [rather] than reality’. 12 This changed when Free Trade Agreements including investment chapters (such as NAFTA and the Energy Charter Treaty13 were concluded between countries with equally strong commitments to democracy and the rule of law. Suddenly, it became evident that foreign investors could challenge national policies in democratic states. Specifically, this entails that a foreign investor is not subject to the same regime as a national investor: where a national investor has no choice but to abide by national regulations, a foreign investor is able to challenge certain measures as per the terms of the BIT. This epitomises the problem of ‘reverse discrimination’ which exists in favour of foreign investors.   b) Reverse discrimination – the threat to constitutional stabilityMuch of the existing literature describes the problems raised by reverse discrimination in rather broad terms: reverse discrimination is accused of generally ‘undermining democratic accountability,14 ’unduly limiting the policy space of signatory governments15 and ‘threatening legitimacy’. 16 The purpose of the present article is to frame the issue of reverse discrimination in much more specific constitutional terms. In doing so, we will reach a clearer understanding of why ISDS, and more specifically reverse discrimination, poses an affront to constitutional stability.   (i) The framework of analysisAs Halberstam sets out, a nation state is a social artefact – its inherent purpose is to further the needs and aspirations of its constituents. 17 From this premise, Dawson and De Witte have concluded that a polity is ’only stable and legitimate, then, if it structurally incorporates and reflects the values that ”matter” to its constituents’. 18 Accordingly, durable legitimacy requires a dual commitment to ‘self-determination’. The first commitment is to ‘political self-determination’: it requires having an institutional mechanism which mediates between competing visions within the polity. 19 This process, which invites all contrasting views to come together in deciding on policy outcomes, enables these very outcomes to be shrouded in a certain legitimacy. The second commitment is to ensure that, from a legal perspective, legal actors are free and equal. 20 We propose to assess ISDS in light of this theoretical framework set out by Dawson and De Witte. We hope to demonstrate the extent to which the very logic of the system, which brings about reverse discrimination, undermines the two central tenets of stability and legitimacy in a nation state. Therein, we contend, lies the real reason for the ISDS system’s legitimacy crisis.   (ii) How does reverse discrimination undermine states' political ownership over laws and regulations?Through the problem of reverse discrimination, ISDS both challenges and undermines states’ ability to decide upon their own rules and regulations. This is epitomised, firstly, by the fact that certain ISDS proceedings result in states having to pay out of public funds for democratically reached policy choices. Kelsey et al. note that this is perceived as particularly problematic when pay-outs are destined to large transnational corporations and redirected away from spending on education and healthcare. 21 In many situations, this problem is amplified by the lack of transparency that covers many investment arbitrations. 22 A number of states have voiced their concerns on this very matter. The South African Government, in their proposal to the UNCITRAL, highlighted that the ISDS system creates a framework where ’the investors’ property and contractual rights supersede public interest and public needs’. 23 Specifically, they raised the point that the system is ’detrimental to public budgets, regulations in the public interest, democracy and the rule of law’. 24 Similar concerns have also been echoed by Brazil and Indonesia before the UNCITRAL. 25 The paradigm example of this problem was demonstrated by the Vattenfall ICSID decision, where a Swedish company, having invested in nuclear energy in Germany, was successful in obtaining compensation for Germany’s political decision to exit from nuclear energy. 26 Against the backdrop of the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (Japan), Germany reached a broad consensus to amend the Atomic Energy Act,27 and thereby abandon the use of nuclear energy by 2022. 28 In conjunction with this amendment, seven further legislative proposals from the federal government were adopted, aiming to bring about a new era of energy policy. 29 Germany’s decision was clearly the outcome of a concerted process. The ISDS system thus seems to make countries pay for reasonable democratic choices.   This case caused specific backlash in German society because Vattenfall was able to circumvent three levels of jurisdiction: national, EU and ECHR, two of which Germany shared with Sweden.     Secondly, the very prospect of being challenged before an investment tribunal has chilling effects on sovereign states’ ability to exercise their authority, an effect which goes beyond the fiscal cost of defending disputes. Indeed, the investment regime, by enabling foreign companies to challenge national measures before an investment tribunal, causes chilling effects both directly (when the threat of investment dispute deters government action) and indirectly (when a country may decide to refrain from adopting a specific measure because it is already involved in numerous disputes). 30 This may lead to a ‘systemic’ chill where policy-making incorporates an assessment of the potential risks of an investment dispute.    One may counter the preceding argument by highlighting that sovereign states are not coerced into entering BITs. As such, being bound by BITs would equally be an expression of national political will, and undermining these international agreements would also amount to thwarting political ownership over decision-making. 31 This argument would be defensible if sovereign states knew exactly the scope of the consequences derived from signing up to BITs. However, as noted above, where legal reciprocity was always a feature of BITs, the factual and economic reciprocity of investment flows has only emerged in recent years.   This is in part due to the economic emergence of developing economies which, in turn, started issuing foreign direct investments. 32 The UNCTAD studied this issue, noting that where developing economies emitted 14% of the world’s share of FDI in the world in 1995, they represented 21% of the world share in 2009,33 a trend that has since continued to rise. In 2014, developing and transitioning economies accounted for 38% of the world share in FDI. 34 A significant portion of this FDI is in fact directed towards developed economies.   In correlation to this increase, developing countries have appeared with increasing frequency before ISDS tribunals in investment disputes. Whereas in 2012 only 11% of claimants hailed from developing or transition economies,35 the number has increasingly surged, amounting to 32% in 2018. 36 Importantly, many of these cases have been brought against developed economies. In an era where Portugal has actively encouraged investment from Angola into its public utilities sector,37 the prospect of developed states defending their policies before investment tribunals has become increasingly likely.   But the emergence of legal reciprocity in investment flows is also attributable to developed states inadvertently agreeing upon investment chapters among themselves. The case in point is the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT),38 which was initially viewed as a multilateral treaty safeguarding EU investments in Eastern European states. 39 As Alvarez notes, after more than a decade the EU realised that the ECT could be used by EU companies to protect foreign investments in fellow member states. 40 This was particularly shocking as it amounted to circumventing the common EU level investment legislation. 41 Historical contingency played a significant role in creating this rare occurrence in international law – by no means do sovereign states regularly commit such consequential errors when reaching international agreements. The Lisbon Treaty, concluded in 2009, provided that all intra-EU investment disputes would be submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union. 42 As such, it had the effect of terminating many pre-existing intra-EU BITs, given their incompatibility with EU law. 43 The Lisbon Treaty, however, was unable to terminate the ECT, which had entered into force in 1998, specifically because it was not a strictly intra-EU BIT. Indeed, the ECT is a binding international treaty that not only includes all of the EU Member States, but also a number of third states. 44 This seemingly anecdotal legal episode has since yielded tremendous consequences for the ISDS system. The UNCTAD estimates that the ECT was invoked in 20% of all investor-state arbitrations world-wide,45 making it the single most frequently invoked mechanism for ISDS. 46 Of these ECT disputes to date, 64% were strictly intra-EU. 47 What this particular situation reveals is the extent to which states sometimes cannot anticipate the full ambit of international mechanisms to which they subscribe. In any case, it is manifest that the ISDS system, through reverse discrimination, challenges sovereign states’ political ownership over their laws and regulations.  Therefore, the ISDS system undermines a core feature of stable constitutions. (iii) How does reverse discrimination undermine freedom and equality amongst actors?As Jan Kleinheisterkamp argues, ISDS grants greater rights to foreign investors than to national investors: this undermines states’ democratic commitment to equality of rights, and means that domestic companies do not have the same freedom to act as their domestic counterparts. 48 The ‘greater rights’ granted to foreign investors manifest themselves in several ways: (i) they allow the foreign investor to explore an avenue for redress which the national investor cannot explore, (ii) they enable foreign investors to claim limitless awards by circumventing the limits that operate on compensation in domestic courts and (iii) they also enable foreign investors to enter into contracts with states without facing the same political risk that a national company would face. Kelsey et al. note that this inequality of rights amongst economic actors significantly distorts market relations in favour of foreign companies: having the ISDS outlet means that the amount of risk incorporated in their investment decisions is largely inferior compared to their domestic counterparts. 49 In an attempt to counter this observation, Christian Riffel, amongst others, posits that ISDS does not undermine states’ commitments to equality before the law. 50 Two broad types of arguments are made to this end.   The first line of counter-argumentThe first line of argument suggests that applying the same rules to national and foreign investors is not desirable since they are in materially different positions to start off with. 51 It therefore sees carving out a specific regime for foreign investors as a way of balancing out the starting positions. An example of this initial difference is the specific due diligence imposed on foreign companies by acts such as the Enterprise Act,52 when entering the UK market. The investment protection system seeks to eliminate this initial difference by implementing standards in international investment treaties which are ’functionally comparable to constitutional guarantees and administrative law principles at the domestic level’. 53 Kleinheisterkamp refers to this as following a ‘logic of substitution’. 54 Foreign investors are not subjected to national judicial procedures which may discriminate against them unfairly – rather, the national procedures are ‘substituted’ by an international procedure which emulates the way national procedures would work for domestic companies. This artificial mechanism thereby intends to cut all discrimination out of the process.   In practice, however, carving out a separate regime for foreign investors does not necessarily have the desired effect of replicating national procedures. One reason for this points to the multitude of different national procedures, and the impossibility for the international regime to reflect all of these accurately. Indeed, each domestic jurisdiction strikes its own subtle balance between ‘the private interests of investors and the public interests of host states. ’55 The provisions encapsulated in BITs are unable to reflect these specific balances because they frame standards of protection in general and open-textured language. It is almost a trite fact that standards of judicial review such as ‘fair and equitable treatment’, ‘full protection and security’ and ‘indirect expropriation’ are highly vague and can be given different content depending on the case at hand, and the panel hearing it. In the Suez case, the UNCITRAL reflected this point by highlighting that the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard can only be defined by terms of ‘almost equal vagueness’. 56 This mismatch between ‘general’ standards in BITs and ‘specific’ balances on the national level reveals the practical impossibility for investment treaty law to satisfy the ‘logic of substitution’ that forms its guiding principle.   A second related reason why carving out a separate regime for foreign investors through BITs does not effectively replicate national procedures is that at times, investment treaty law creates more favourable conditions for foreign investors than would be available under national law for domestic companies. This problem of ‘reverse discrimination’ is a direct consequence of the aforementioned vagueness of BIT standards, and of the important discretion that investment tribunals have in ascribing content to these provisions. Because of this latitude, individual tribunals can confer awards to foreign investors where equivalent awards would not be available to domestic companies appearing before national courts.   The case in point is Vattenfall:57 had Vattenfall been a domestic company, it would plainly have not been able to recoup its investment. Importantly, the decision in Vattenfall does not represent a one-off anomaly but falls within a broader trend. A couple of salient examples are the cases of Masdar v. Spain58 and Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador59, which replicate the Vattenfall format, enabling foreign investors to benefit from ISDS in a way which was unavailable to domestic companies. This is not to say that investment treaty law systematically creates inverse discrimination in favour of foreign investors – in many occasions, international investment tribunals are able to track national procedures. In this sense, Lowe is not exactly right when he asserts that ’the consequence is plain and inescapable. BITs give foreign investors wider rights than nationals possess’. 60 Rather, BITs create the potential for foreign investors to have wider rights than nationals possess. However, what matters for the purposes of our analysis is that this potential exists – and that this potential sometimes comes to fruition. Indeed, what this demonstrates is that the separate regime for foreign investors does not, and cannot, successfully and systematically replicate national procedures. The potential for reverse discrimination inherent to investment treaty law therefore means that it does not, as Riffel suggests, successfully correct the initial imbalance between national and foreign investors. Their unequal position in front of the law is maintained. Moreover, this line of argument which supports the separate system of investment treaty law for foreign investors is also flawed because it does not account for the idea that a company’s choice to enter a foreign market carries an inherent responsibility to adhere by domestic laws. 61 These are considerations that should be internalised by companies when they decide to make a foreign direct investment.   The second line of counter-argumentThe second line of argument posits that in practice, there is no material difference between the treatment of foreign companies under investment treaty law and that of domestic companies under domestic law, and therefore it would be erroneous to view investment treaty law as creating inequality. 62 The example given for this point is that ’domestic law may make available the same remedies as an international investment agreement’. 63 Viewed alongside the first line of argument, it seems that supporters of ISDS are trying to have it both ways. Riffel stresses that investment treaty law both creates and doesn’t create inequality. 64 More importantly, as Kleinheisterkamp highlights, although in theory domestic remedies do exist, in practice the domestic paths to accessing such remedies are much more saturated than they are for investment tribunals. 65 As such, it would be plainly incorrect to assert that both investment tribunals and domestic courts lead to equal outcomes. It is therefore clear that ISDS, structured to create reverse discrimination, compromises national constitutional commitments to freedom and equality of all actors before the law.   (iv) Constitutional compromising: why now?What transpires from this analysis is that the very logic of investment treaty law, which carves out a different regime for foreign investors, undermines the central tenets of a stable and legitimate constitution within a polity: (i) political ownership over common rules and (ii) freedom and equality of all actors before the law. The ISDS’s substantive legitimacy crisis stems from its inherent incompatibility with the core constitutional values within states.   Yet, one may ponder why it is only now that the birth defects in the system are coming to the surface and creating a substantive legitimacy crisis. The first reason, detailed above, is that the legal reciprocity of BITs is only now accompanied by reciprocal investment flows. This is the case between developed and developing nations, but also between developing nations themselves. 66 This trend has been accelerated by recent cases, such as Masdar v Spain,67 where an increasingly broad interpretation of ‘investment’ has been adopted. Whereas ‘investment’ used to be reserved for significant transnational acquisitions of property, the term now seems vague enough to capture ordinary commercial transactions. 68 Indeed, as Tim Samples demonstrates, economic and technological developments have changed the nature of investments, and therefore changed the definition of ‘investment’. 69 Early generation BITs could not envisage, in their drafting, the current scope of investment treaty law. 70 The second reason is that a number of landmark cases in the last few decades have shown that investment treaty law is being exploited by Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to avoid accountability in host states. One such case is Methanex Corporation v. the United States which raised this point in light of environmental rules. 71 In the late 1990s, a Canadian investor sued the United States because California had banned certain additives to car fuel for the protection of the environment. The idea that a foreign company could sue the United States because California was trying to protect its environment and public health caused a huge uproar in the United States – the matter was hotly debated by the House of Representatives. 72  Although in this case the investment tribunal ruled in favour of the United States, it opened the floodgates to foreign investors challenging domestic laws in ISDS. A number of more recent cases have been won by investors challenging national environmental regulations,73 but also challenging regulations in a host of other policy areas. These include cases on essential services,74 financial stability,75 and development and industrial policy. 76 Such decisions have, in the past decade, increased attention on the investment treaty regime’s role in undermining national accountability. Doing so has revealed the substantive challenges to the system’s structural legitimacy. 77   Conclusion: The ISDS system’s substantive legitimacy crisis is caused by the inherent logic of the system itself – for this reason, it simply cannot become legitimate. Threatening to increasingly undermine constitutional commitments at the national level, it is urgent for the regime as a whole to be repealed. Only through such drastic measures will the substantive challenges posed by ISDS be addressed. The EU has started to realise the extent of the problem posed by reverse discrimination. Following the ECJ ruling in Achmea,78 where it was declared that Intra-EU BITs were contrary to EU law, 23 EU Member states (all except Austria, Ireland, Finland and Sweden) have signed on 5 May 2020 the ‘Agreement for the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between the Member States of the European Union’. What such an agreement will reap is uncertain, but its existence certainly does signal a formal recognition of the substantive challenges contained in the ISDS regime.

    "body": "2021/01/18 - AbstractThe economic fallout from the novel coronavirus is being felt worldwide. As a consequence, the international market chain has experienced imminent delays in performance of contractual obligations. An existing uniform international regime which can provide for effective enforceability and renegotiation of asset-based contracts is UNIDROIT: its Principles on Commercial Contracts, the Cape Town Convention, and related protocols. In this context, we argue the case for the majority, the underrepresented and the most affected in this scenario: the debtors/lessors in the transport sector. We contend that the current financial crisis can be improved by adopting the alternatives that UNIDROIT instruments provide. In furtherance, the three parts of our article purport to provide: i) a contextual overview of the economic impact of COVID-19 on Airlines and Railways; ii) an analysis of the condition of the Airlines and the Railway industries using the UNIDROIT documents which govern the legal aspects of this issue; and finally iii) plausible solutions to reduce this economic burden. 1. UNIDROIT: An Overview of the Existing NormsUNIDROIT’s Principles of International Commercial Contracts establish a legal framework to articulate the principles underlying asset-based financing and leasing, and protect other such related interests. 1 Similarly, the Cape Town Convention and its Protocols are standardised rules to be followed while engaging in transnational business transactions. Specific to mobile equipment, the Convention lays down certain objectives to facilitate asset-based financing and leasing, protect the interests of all parties, and create a legal framework for international interests. The most significant aspect of the Cape Town Convention is the trifurcation between air, railway, and space assets, creating a comprehensive yet definite framework for each. 2 The Luxembourg Protocol utilizes the Cape Town Convention as a baseline while accommodating the specific requirements of the railway industry, integrating these elements in a vital transnational instrument.   2. The Impact FactorThe recent COVID-19 health crisis has had a profound impact on all forms of travel and transportation. Both the aviation and railway sectors have been significant casualties of the worldwide shutdowns of domestic and cross-border trade and travel. 3 The most significant impact on airline companies has been due to a slump in demand among travellers as a result of the multiple travel restrictions. Several airlines have declared bankruptcy,4 many have ceased operations, while other airlines reported a reduction in flights after a decade of expansion. 5 Statistics show that, on an average, 10% of flights around the world   were cancelled in early March 2020, in stark contrast to 2019. 6 As the pandemic gained traction in late March, the recorded flight movements reduced almost 40–60% with international flights being affected the most. Unfortunately, research also shows that global recovery of passenger demand to pre-COVID-19 levels is estimated to take almost two years, with the most optimistic loss estimate being a whopping USD 84 billion (GBP 63. 23 billion). 7 On the other hand, estimates on the railway sector suggest that the fallout from the health crisis will cause global rail passenger revenue losses to the tune of USD 60 billion (GBP 45 billion) in 2020 and further seep into 2021. 8 The freight sector alone is expected to lose approximately USD 26 billion (GBP 19. 5 billion) this year. 9 Statistics from both sectors put into perspective the scale of the financial blowback being experienced by operators, investors and financial institutions. This situation has a direct impact on leasing agreements as well, as lessors will look to prematurely terminate agreements due to factors like non-payment. During these tumultuous times, the interests of various stakeholders in the concerned industry must be protected. This is where UNIDROIT’s instruments offer effective solutions. 3. AIRLINES3. 1. Flying and Non-PerformanceCOVID-19 has caused the termination of contractual relations, mainly due to the breach of obligations and pulling-out by major global investors from industries that were once the benchmark for stock-market performance. Primarily, the virus has devastated airlines, giving creditors or investor-firms like Berkshire Hathaway no incentive to hold on to their airline stakes. 10 Firms have sold shares as they anticipated a huge risk sending the entire industry into a competitive spiral that could potentially damage profits, sales, and investor returns. We argue that nations must therefore collectively reinstate investor optimism to help airline shares take-off. Hence, we aim to begin the discussion by i) highlighting the main UNIDROIT principles and providing our perspectives on the frustration of payment obligations by airlines, ii) elaborating on the legal protections and remedies that the UNIDROIT Convention on the International Interests in Mobile Equipment provides to affected parties. i) Airline Payment Obligations and UNIDROITAeroplanes require high-maintenance, a process that runs up millions of dollars in costs. 11 Periodic maintenance is not cheap either; it demands investment in building and maintaining terminals at large airports. 12 Airlines pay fees to airports to rent their gates and slots, which binds them to long-term contracts with operators. They are also locked into third party contractor agreements to hedge jet fuel prices. 13 Yet, the impossibility of performing their part of such contracts is not rare for airline companies. Therefore, UNIDROIT Principles (“Principles”) of International Commercial Contracts may take effect in suitable scenarios, and attempt to prevent global economies from periodic busts, protecting airlines’ legal rights. a) Applicable Principles: Hardship v. Force MajeureA plain reading of the document reveals that the text of these Principles must serve as a model for national legislators. To that end, a comprehensive textual understanding is needed. The relevant provisions for consideration are: Article 6. 2. 2 of the document14, which defines ‘hardship’; Article 7. 1. 715 which defines force majeure; and Comment 6 on Article 6. 2. 216 which deliberates the possibility of both occurring together. In this context, COVID-19 would become a ‘hardship’ (by virtue of it being an event beyond the control of the disadvantaged party) and a force majeure (as such an impediment could not have been taken into account at the time of conclusion of the contract). The Supreme Court of Canada, in Churchill Falls v. Hydro-Québec17, recently provided clarity on the first aspect: ‘hardship’. Notwithstanding that the facts of the case did not admit the adoption of the above-stated Principles, the judgment articulated important lessons on the broader obligations of contracting parties and reimposed parties’ right of renegotiation. The decision reads in the context of COVID-19, ‘…for example, in a situation of ‘hardship’ that corresponds to the description of that concept set out in the UNIDROIT Principles, the conduct of the contracting party who benefits from the change in circumstances cannot be disregarded and must be assessed’ (emphasis added). 18 The Court also noted that an inflexible or a ‘gratuitously impatient or intransigent’ party, in these exigent circumstances, would violate the good faith duty under equity. On the second aspect of force majeure, courts in India and other countries have generally construed that impossibility of performance pursuant to an unforeseeable event is a suitable justification in restraining specific performance obligations. 19 Where Scottish or English regimes are concerned, the decision would not only depend on the circumstances but also on the drafting of the particular contractual provisions. 20 This position is similar in Singapore as well. 21 However, in a factual situation where both ‘hardship’ and force majeure occur, as contemplated in Comment 6 of Article 6. 2. 2, we suggest that invoking hardship would be the best choice. Carrier organisations may need to re-evaluate the legitimate hazard that may emerge under their agreements with third-party contractors, for activities including refuelling, providing food, runway development and repairs, aeroplane maintenance and upgrades, and flight dispatches. Therefore, if airlines invoke ‘hardship’ under the Principles as the rationale behind breach, they can expect not only that their non-performance be excused, but also that the terms of such long-term contracts be renegotiated for the purpose of keeping the contract alive, albeit on revised terms. These relaxations would allow them short-term benefits like improved cash-flow, as well as achieving long-term goals such as general restructuring. ii) Suggestions for a New Lease of LifeThis section details the protections and remedies that may be sought by airline debtors and lessors. Firstly, given that the carrier organisations have suspended their businesses, it is necessary to determine if defaults would be triggered under the various financial understandings entered into by these companies. Where an occasion of default is triggered upon a deliberate suspension of business, such an interruption is generally an immediate outcome of governmental guidelines. That would be outside the scope of such an agreement, and fall under the purview of the Cape Town Convention. Secondly, it is necessary to ascertain if an occasion of default is qualified by the ‘material adverse change’22 requirement. This would reflect on the borrower’s capacity to play out their legally binding commitments. In the event that there is a critical effect on the borrower’s capacity to pay, this will probably fulfil the widely used test of ‘material adverse change’. 23 Thirdly, it is normal that post-COVID-19 and after the lifting of lockdown orders, for reasons including budgetary and operational challenges, carrier organisations will be unable to immediately resume operations in all regions or may not be in a situation to recommission their fleets. Considering this, it would be suitable for nations to survey the occasion of default and the cessation of business in their financial agreements involving security interests. It could be contended that impermanent terminations post-COVID-19 would establish said cessation of business. 24 Subsequently, it would be judicious for nations to introduce policies aligned with the Cape Town Convention, to allow aircraft organisations to audit their facility agreements, while considering COVID-19 related measures and the effect such measures may have on their financing plans. Fourthly and finally, the carrier organisations may consider approaching their lessors for concessions according to their respective rent commitments (by virtue of the liquidity crunch resulting in falling ticket demand). 25 For instance, the largest domestic airline in India InterGlobe Aviation Limited, which operates IndiGo’s fleet, has received 50% relief on supplementary rent, generally used to cover maintenance costs, as the greater part of IndiGo’s fleet remains grounded due to COVD-19. 26 While the lessors might be qualified to make decay demands for such concessions on rent commitments, the Convention would prevent them from doing so and would also give the lessee some leeway in these unprecedented times. Therefore, it will be advantageous to consider the alleviation bundle or concessions which a carrier organisation looks for from the lessors and which must incorporate a concurred period, with a specific amount of reimbursement to recover the unpaid rents. Such patience on occasion of default can therefore come at an expense, like delayed repayment, but also be highly beneficial to the lessees. 3. 2. The Road AheadFor the industry to get back on track, states must ensure the provision of credit-financing for aviation assets to alleviate the circumstances that the increasingly bankrupt airline industry faces. Secondly, the borrowing costs must be revised and decreased in accordance with the Principles to enable economic regrowth. Thirdly, the continuous cooperation of states will ensure that consumer demand for commercial aircraft increases, thereby effectuating increased transnational air travel. In the context of the judiciary and their interference in commercial contract matters, tempered literal interpretations of certain contracts have to be effected in order to protect the underlying obligations intended by the parties. Good faith confers a broad, flexible power to create law, which helps tie various legal principles to the concept of fundamental justice, depending on the circumstances, in an effort to protect contractual equilibrium. 27 In the same vein, the fundamentally altered equilibrium in the aviation sector has to be set right, and nations should ratify documents such as the UNIDROIT’s Principles and render justice to those industries who are exposed to a substantially greater risk than others. 4. RAILWAYS4. 1. Addressing financial concerns in the Railway sectorThe railway sector plays a pivotal role in keeping the gears of the global economy turning. It is estimated that by 2025, the global rolling stock market size will reach USD 75 billion (equivalent to GBP 57. 1 billion). 28 These numbers illustrate the sheer scale on which railways operate and, more importantly, they highlight the need for adequate safeguards for investments. This section is devoted to three aspects in this regard: i) highlighting the scope of the Luxembourg Protocol, ii) enumerating the liquidity crisis among operators, and iii) addressing the remedies it provides on insolvency.   4. 2. Scope of the Luxembourg ProtocolThe Luxembourg Rail Protocol (Protocol) was ratified in 2007, using The Cape Town Convention as a broad framework, while taking into account the specific requirements of the rail industry. The objective of the Protocol has been interpreted as follows: ‘It seeks to facilitate, worldwide, more extensive private sector finance for rolling stock, reduce barriers to entry to the rail sector, and resolve important cross-border legal issues as a result of more diverse, extensive and less expensive private sector finance for railway rolling stock. ’29 Broadly speaking, the Protocol addresses two immediate concerns in the rail sector, namely default remedies and registry provisions. Under the former, it enumerates remedies on insolvency, insolvency assistance, and provisions for debtors. The latter concern, on the other hand, encapsulates: the authority of the registrar, designation of entry points, identification of rolling stock, and notices of sale. With a wide scope in terms of its application, the Protocol has an important role to play in combating the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. i) Mitigating the liquidity crisisDuring this crisis, certain issues have taken precedence. Low foot and freight traffic have prompted a liquidity crisis and pushed operators towards a staggering loss of revenue. 30 States have been actively involved in assisting their railways over the past few years, and more so since the beginning of COVID-19. 31 The French government absorbed EUR 35 million (GBP 31 billions) of debt from SNCF in 2018,32 and will help out the national operator again this financial year. 33 According to the Office of National Statistics of the UK, British train companies have effectively been re-nationalised temporarily to survive,34 and Angela Merkel and the Bundestag have sought to raise the debt ceiling of the German Deutsche Bahn to cope with the crisis. 35 While state-owned firms have more leeway, private entities are left to fend for themselves. Union Pacific has reported its worst quarter since the 2008 Financial Crisis,36 while both Canadian National and CSX experienced 18. 9 and 26% drops in revenue respectively. 37,38,39 Amtrak saw a mammoth 95% drop in ridership,40 pushing an already loss-saturated entity into restructuring its operations. Amidst the chaos, states and operators are looking for any sort of relief from incessant financial pressure. 4. 3 Remedies on insolvency and their applications during the pandemicThe Protocol presents three different alternatives for creditors and debtors in situations where insolvency may occur. In the first alternative,41 the insolvency administrator shall give possession of the rolling stock to the creditor upon default. This represents a safety net for creditors as, if the debtor’s position becomes untenable, they may take possession of tangible assets. However, there is a reasonable waiting period for the debtor to put across their case. The debtor is not precluded from using the rolling stock, as long as its value does not depreciate through such use. Most importantly, the debtor can retain possession of the rolling stock if it cures all the defaults other than a default constituted by the opening of insolvency proceedings, and has agreed to perform all future obligations under the agreement and related transaction document within the waiting period.   The second alternative allows the debtor to issue a notice to the creditor,42 stating its position with regards to meeting its financial obligations or allow the creditor to take possession of the stock. This option gives debtors the chance to represent their situation to creditors. The final option prescribes a period within which the debtor agrees to cure all defaults and agrees to perform all future obligations. 43 The assets are turned over to the creditor upon a failure to do so. Prior to the completion of this cure period, the debtor is also empowered to approach a court seeking a stay on repossession of the assets, provided they can fulfil their obligations to the creditor during such suspension period. It is important to keep in mind that each contract is unique and therefore a singular solution can cause friction between the involved parties. These alternatives therefore provide three comprehensive courses of action. In the context of the current situation, the second and third alternatives are of utmost relevance. As various operators face liquidity crunches, it is practically impossible for them to meet their immediate debt obligations. Additionally, Article X of the Protocol also provides for insolvency assistance requiring courts in the contracting state to cooperate with foreign bodies and jurisdictions, which would prove to be conducive to dealing with the situation at hand. However, a gradual pickup of traffic seems likely. Debtors can, therefore, likely transfer their risk to the creditors, with assurances that the situation will improve. Should a reasonable cure period be negotiated, it would ensure that debtors have adequate time to cure their obligations without sacrificing the creditors’ stakes in the operation. 4. 4 Using the Protocol efficiently to manage the crisis: A SuggestionUltimately, the aforementioned statistics are just a small insight into the magnitude of COVID-19’s impact. Even the most optimistic estimates do not suggest a strong pickup of economic growth before the second half of 2021,44 and railways across the globe will continue to face contractions before a gruelling recovery. Hence, debtors need to be protected from financial ruin by using the relevant insolvency provisions. At the same time, this cannot compromise on the interests of creditors. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the relevant alternatives provided by the Protocol, in order to find one that meets the expectations of all parties. Additionally, the international registry must facilitate large-scale coordination between parties. By providing pertinent information about rolling stock, the registry must aid parties in making informed decisions about the procurement, sale, and movement of such stock. On this, the Protocol has been ratified to protect the interests of various players in the field, and the pandemic could very well be its hour of reckoning. 5. ConclusionThe problems we have addressed arise primarily from the fact that legal systems have various approaches to securities and lease agreements, which creates uncertainty for lending institutions and borrowers regarding the efficacy of their rights. This issue can be dealt with, summarily, by adopting the foregoing measures. Therefore, amidst the uncertainty around the pandemic, the implementation of the UNIDROIT Principles will be pivotal to ensure that air operators can stem the haemorrhage of money and that they will be able to return to normalcy once the crisis ends. To manage the fallout from the pandemic, the Luxembourg Protocol must be utilized to its fullest in order to provide an equitable, comprehensive and efficient method to manage the fallout from the pandemic while preparing entities to return to their normal capacities. It would also be prudent to encourage a greater number of states to ratify the Cape Town Convention and its protocols in order to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive system of investment protection. We believe that the adoption of such principles for special needs during extraordinary circumstances would lead to a better global understanding of broader concepts like contractual stability and fairness: concepts which UNIDROIT has championed in the international arena.

    "title": "Unintentional Transmission of Disease Revisited – a Tort Law Perspective on COVID-19",
    "body": "2020/11/02 - IntroductionCan individuals infected with COVID-19 sue those who unintentionally transmitted the novel coronavirus to them? This article explores the effectiveness of using the tort of negligence as a legal tool to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 1 In particular, there exists a wide duty of care upon each individual towards another’s physical well-being not to transmit the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – the cause of the highly infectious COVID-19 disease that transpired into a global pandemic. 2 Considerations for the reasonableness of departing from the orthodox approach on duty of care derived from other commutable diseases are informed by the novel features of COVID-19, and possible perverse incentives not to seek early testing if the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 is defined too narrowly. Having established this duty of care, the argument then considers using a proportionality test to assess the standard of care, balancing individual autonomy against public health considerations, the value of which would be to limit this tortious liability in practice. Lastly, this article further explores the potential difficulties in proving causation and proposes to adopt the Bonnington test based on material contribution to cumulative physical injuries. Notwithstanding the paucity of case law related to COVID-19, this article conducts a comparative analysis with the current literature related to the transmission of other types of viral diseases, particularly the deadly Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In the meantime, it shall be noted from the outset that discussion related to the possible use of strict liability regime or intentional torts to control the spread of COVID-19 (which could even become subjects of criminal prosecution) are beyond the scope of this article.    Duty of Care The rationale underlying the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 shall first be assessed under the common law’s two models of tort, namely the Model of Wrongs and the Model of Costs. Under the Model of Wrongs3, corollary to an individual’s right to physical health is another’s duty to respect the other person’s state of natural health. Such a duty gives rise to a standard of conduct in relation to COVID-19 transmission (discussed later in this article), to which failure to comply results a wrong being committed. In justifying this duty, Ripstein’s conception of mutual independence4, and thus the duty not to take charge of others’ means, would see a duty incumbent upon each individual not to conduct him/herself in a way that negligently transmits COVID-19 to the harm of another’s body. In comparison, Calabresi’s Model of Costs5 would seek to allocate the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 upon the party “best placed” to decide on the most efficient way of minimising costs related to COVID-19 transmission. Here, a potentially COVID-19-infectious individual is arguably the “best decider” of his or her own risk of COVID-19 transmission and the associated costs of taking precaution against such transmission. Indeed, a caveat is attached to the word “arguably” because the state might be the “better decider” than potentially COVID-19-infectious individuals, if, for example, a majority of the population unduly under-estimates the severity of COVID-19. This might furnish sufficient grounds for the state to intervene by introducing relevant regulations to manage COVID-19 transmissions. 6. = Nevertheless, a legislative debate is beyond the purview of this article; and for present purpose, it is sufficient to see potentially COVID-19-infectious individuals being at least the “better decider” vis-à-vis COVID-19 victims, thus placing on the former the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 under a liability regime. In this respect, both the Model of Wrongs and the Model of Costs could be used to understand the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19, albeit from different perspectives.   In fact, the Calabresi “best-decider” Model of Costs also sheds light on who should potentially become amendable to the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19. Understandably, a potentially COVID-19-infectious individual has better knowledge of his or her own social interaction history than COVID-19 victims. This superior knowledge thus puts a potentially COVID-19-infectious individual in a better position vis-à-vis a COVID-19 victim to decide how COVID-19 transmission from him/herself should best be reduced. This reasoning not only forms the basis of the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19, but also explains established duties of care not to negligently transmit other types of commutable diseases. This is in line with other common law jurisdictions (particularly US jurisdictions) that have engaged the issue of disease transmission using tort liability regimes. For example, in Hendricks v. Butcher7, the Missouri Court of Appeal established a duty of care for those with smallpox virus not to spread their infection; in Berner v. Caldwell8, the Supreme Court of Alabama also imposed a duty on individuals infected with herpes to protect his or her sexual partners from infection. Nevertheless, the different symptoms and modes of transmission of smallpox, herpes, and COVID-19 could mean that the scope of tort liability would be different for each disease. The characteristic skin sores on smallpox patients9, and the transmission of herpes through sexual activities10, imply that those who do not demonstrate the relevant smallpox symptoms, or those who do not engage in the relevant sexual activities, would not need to bear any duties as the “best decider”  – because there exist no costs to minimise in the first place. In contrast, the air-borne capability of SARS-CoV-211 and the asymptomatic spread of COVID-1912 could make everyone potentially infectious. As the UK Coronavirus Act 2020, Schedule 21 Part 1 Section 2(1) aptly provides: a person is “potentially infectious” at any time if:  a)    the person is, or may be, infected or contaminated with coronavirus, and there is a risk that the person might infect or contaminate others with coronavirus, or b)    the person has been in an infected area within the 14 days preceding that time. 13 At the time of this writing, COVID-19 has spread across 213 countries and territories across the globe. 14 It is therefore safe to say that any travellers entering the UK would qualify as “potentially infectious” by virtue of Section 2(1)(b) for being within an area reported to have coronavirus within the preceding 14 days. However, it is also worth noting that Section 2(1) only refers to countries, territories, and areas outside the UK. 15 Nevertheless, given that the UK itself ranks the 14th globally for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases at the time of this writing16, the territories that shall be deemed as “potentially infectious”, for the normative purpose of this article, shall be understood to also include the UK. Arguably, such a wide duty of care might seem to undermine the principle of minimum intervention and individual autonomy. However, defining the scope of tort liability surrounding COVID-19 based on the traditional jurisprudence of other types of viral diseases would be guilty of ignoring the novel features of COVID-19 discussed above. In addition, there also exist public policy grounds that would make a wide-ranging duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 compatible with the “fair, just, reasonable” requirement of the Caparo test. 17 At the time of this writing, testing facilities for COVID-19 are still not readily accessible in many parts of the world18, and suspected patients cannot get their test results immediately after taking the diagnostic test. 19 This potential double delay in both getting a test and getting the result of a test, coupled with the highly commutable nature of SARS-CoV-2,20 would result in considerable virus leak within the community between the time the suspected patient seeks to access a test and the time the patient is confirmed as a positive case of COVID-19. Such virus leak and the consequent build-up of yet-to-confirm COVID-19 patients would result in further delay in receiving test results, if the testing capacity of the locality did not expand at a rate commensurate with the infection rate. This consequently sets up a vicious cycle in which further virus leak is perpetuated within the larger community.   Additionally, if the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 is only limited to those individuals who received positive results from their COVID-19 tests, this would, on the contrary, create perverse incentives for people not to seek testing at an early stage. If individuals fear that they may have COVID-19 and the test results transpired to be positive, they can readily face liability in negligence if the virus was indeed transmitted to others. Instead, the claimants would not be able to establish a duty to act if people do not take COVID-19 tests and are therefore ignorant of their diseases. Although the doctrine of wilful blindness21 may capture those defendants who deliberately close their minds to further inquiries in fear of validating their suspicion, this doctrine is nonetheless only effective in exceptional cases when the possibility of being COVID-19-positive is obvious. However, asymptomatic spread is what has made COVID-19 so hard to control, thus making early-stage testing and speedy diagnosis even more important than for other types of viral diseases. Undoubtedly, such perverse incentive would be dangerous from a public health perspective. If potentially infectious individuals are unaware that they are carriers of SARS-CoV-2, they might unknowingly transmit the virus to others through subsequent social encounters, spreading the virus exponentially to the greater community.   Therefore, in view of the novel features of COVID-19 and the above analysis on the dire public health consequences on limiting the duty of care only to confirmed COVID-19 patients, there is indeed a case to depart from the conventional duty of care established in the jurisprudence of other commutable diseases. Considerations for the extent of the negligence liability related to COVID-19 transmission would be assessed through careful calibration of the standard of care, which would be discussed below. Standard of CareAccording to Bolton v. Stone22, a defendant is not negligent if the risk of foreseeable damage is small and the cost of taking precaution is disproportionately high. In the context of COVID-19, this involves balancing the reasonably perceived risk of transmitting COVID-19 against the cost of taking preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Various preventive measures could attract different degrees of cost on an individual’s autonomy, ranging from comparatively small inconvenience such as social distancing for a certain radius, or wearing a mask, goggles, or a face shield, to comparatively greater limitation on one’s movement such as self-isolation or quarantine. Similarly, for corporate entities, there is also a spectrum of costs related to taking various preventive measures, ranging from the provision of sanitising and protective equipment, enhanced cleaning regimes, and reduced business capacity for social-distancing measures, to ultimate shut-down of business. What specific preventive measures that each individual (or corporate entity) has to take – and consequently what degrees of cost that each individual (or corporate entity) has to bear – in discharge of their duty of care would depend on a reasonable perception of both the consequences and the risks of COVID-19 transmission in individual circumstances. In this regard, in assessing how much individual autonomy should be compromised, this article proposes a proportionality test in determining the standard of care, balancing the cost of taking preventive measures against both the consequences and the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others.   However, in applying this proportionality test, even in the jurisprudence of other commutable diseases, there is no clear line regarding how substantial a risk must be before the defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence. In the case of HIV infections (decided in the tort law context), in Mussivand v. David23, the Ohio Supreme Court held that “a person who knows, or should know, that he or she is infected with a venereal disease has the duty to abstain from sexual conduct or, at a minimum, to warn those persons with whom he or she expects to have sexual relations of his or her condition”. In Doe v. Roe24, the New York Court of Appeal stated that the use of a condom may even shield defendants from negligence liability. Similarly, the Law Commission of England and Wales25 even considered whether disclosure of disease status is still required when the risk of STD transmission is low, either because the infected person used a condom, or was undergoing antiretroviral treatment. All these have shown that even infected individuals may nonetheless be deemed to have exercised an acceptable level of care without having to refrain from sexual activities. Despite the differences between STD and COVID-19 discussed in the previous section, both viral diseases are at least commutable among humans and preventive measures including wearing a condom (in the case of STD) and wearing a mask (in the case of COVID-19) are preventive measures aimed to significantly reduce, though not to eradicate, transmission. This is in line with the Learned Hand test26 under the Model of Costs (and indeed the reasoning behind Bolton v. Stone 27 which requires precautions to be taken only if the statistical multiple of the probability and the consequence of harm is cost-effective. Both sexual activities (in the case of STD transmission) and social interactions (in the case of COVID-19 transmission) are fundamentally desirable activities that the law does not discourage – but only if carried out in a cost-efficient way. Therefore, in the context of COVID-19, a potentially infectious individual may not necessarily have to go to the extent of undergoing self-isolation to discharge the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 – mask-wearing is likely to be sufficient in ordinary circumstances. Having said so, it must be noted that Calabresi’s Model of Costs28 also requires individuals to consider the consequences of transmission. 29 Specifically, in view of the higher risk of severe COVID-19 for older adults30 and people with underlying health conditions31, potentially infectious individuals need to exercise greater care than simply wearing masks in order to discharge their duty of care. Ignorance of these special circumstances, where greater care is required to prevent COVID-19 transmission to individuals at increased risks, is unlikely to succeed as a defence, in view of the wide-spread media coverage of COVID-19 and its related specialty risks. In the meantime, it is also impossible to ignore the strength of the counterargument based on individual autonomy, which finds its support in the jurisprudence of other types of viral diseases. In the context of STD, both Weait32 and Cherkassky 33 have argued that everyone has a responsibility to minimise the transmission of STD and people who do not ask their partners whether or not they are infected should be responsible for failing to protect their own health. With due respect, this argument still does not attenuate the defendants’ liability for engaging in acts that they knew to be potentially harmful and indeed had harmed others. 34 In fact, allowance has already been made to defendants’ autonomy by allowing consent to be used as a justificatory defence. In this regard, informed consent by the victim should be seen as the ultimate acknowledgement that defendants had done what they could reasonably be expected to do in the circumstances to protect victims from potential harm. Having said so, applying the doctrine of informed consent to COVID-19 would produce bizarre and economically costly results in everyday interactions. For one thing, a person who is aware or suspects that she is a carrier of COVID-19 would need to seek everyone’s consent before she could board the Tube. This is clearly not viable in practice.    As an alternative to informed consent, the operation of implied consent35 presumes that riders of public transport have consented to the risk of contracting COVID-19 when they boarded the crowded Tube – either because they perceive the consequence of infection as not serious enough or the risk of infection as an obvious and acceptable fact. Therefore, wearing a mask is seemingly not a matter of fulfilling one’s duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 to others, but rather a measure of self-protection adopted by individuals who do not wish to be taken as impliedly consented to the risk of contracting COVID-19 when moving around in public. A corollary of this argument is that any preventive measures mentioned in this section shall only be adopted on a voluntary basis and must not be mandated. Indeed, as in the context of STD, risk taking, whether or not related to disease transmission, had always been a feature of consensual sexual activities, which society had not sought to intervene in the past.   Such an argument based on individual autonomy and the doctrine of implied consent relies on the important assumption that potential victims are fully aware of the actual risks of infection. However, this is simply not true in the context of COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 does not express distinct physical manifestations, individuals cannot be presumed to know that the person standing next to him/her is a carrier of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, consent to interacting with others in public cannot be presumed as consent to contracting COVID-19 in law. In fact, if victims are presumed to appreciate the risk of COVID-19 in any social encounters, there would exist no basis for liability of disease transmission based on fraudulent misrepresentation. This is because there cannot exist any deception to the risk of transmission in the first place if individuals are expected and presumed to know such risk themselves. As such, the presumption that victims would always be aware of the risk of transmission is a dangerous fantasy, which could render moot the liability for disease transmission through deception and risk failing to protect the most vulnerable victims.   In essence, neither informed consent nor implied consent based on considerations for individual autonomy is tenable in the context of COVID-19. In law, taking preventive measures such as wearing a mask is not a matter of individual risk-assessment under the doctrine of implied consent, but a means of discharging the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 under the tort of negligence. Consideration for individual autonomy is nonetheless incorporated in the proportionality test assessing the standard of care.    Causation In practice, causation might be the biggest hurdle in establishing liability for negligently transmitting COVID-19. At the time of this writing, SARS-CoV-2 is known to be capable of being transmitted through aerosols36 and fomites. 37 This makes it costly, if not impossible, in practice to determine which particular droplet of SARS-CoV-2 had infected the victim. A patient might already have inhaled a non-tortious airborne nucleus of SARS-CoV-2 before contracting the droplet of SARS-CoV-2 from the negligent defendant. Therefore, the orthodox route in establishing causation through the Barnett 38 ’but-for’39 test is hard to satisfy in the context of COVID-19. 40 Nevertheless, in Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw41 , the court had assisted claimants to overcome this evidential gap by finding causation in situations where it could be shown that the tortious exposure to the silica dust had materially contributed to the claimant’s harm, even if it was not the only cause.  In the context of COVID-19, a research report published by the Lancet Infectious Disease Medical Journal on 1st June 2020 found that “(t)he mean viral load of severe (COVID-19) cases was around 60 times higher than that of mild cases”, with data indicating that “similar to SARS in 2002–03, patients with severe COVID-19 tend to have a high viral load and a long virus shedding period”. 42 This finding not only suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 might be a useful indicator for assessing COVID-19 severity and prognosis, but also indicates, importantly, that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms aggravates in cumulo with SARS-COV-2 load. Therefore, similar to Bonnington in which the incremental nature of the claimant’s pneumoconiosiswas attributable to the cumulative effect of both the tortious and non-tortious silica dust, the cumulative nature of COVID-19 symptoms also makes the disease incremental, in which the disease aggravates with each exposure and is thus a divisible injury in law. Consequently, causation could be established on the basis that the defendant’s breach of duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 had made a material contribution to the claimant’s disease, even if the claimant could have first contracted SARS-CoV-2 from a non-tortious source. Causation based on this cumulative effect of divisible diseases is highlighted by Lord Keith in Bonnington itself:  Prima facie the particles inhaled are acting cumulatively, and I think the natural inference is that had it not been for the cumulative effect the pursuer would not have developed pneumoconiosis when he did and might not have developed it at all. 43 However, a further difficulty inherent in the “Bonnington causation” lies in the apportionment of damages. In the context of COVID-19, there has been no acceptable scientifically supported evidentiary basis on which concurrent inhalation of both tortious and non-tortious SARS-CoV-2 could be apportioned to individual sources (such was the situation in Thompson v Smiths Shiprepairers (North Shields) Ltd44, in which conventional apportionment could be carried out by the court because the causal factors of the claimant’s injury operated consecutively rather than concurrently). This has consequently resulted in a dilemma whereby diseases like COVID-19 are divisible in theory but indivisible in reality. 45 In this regard, given that English courts have well-established that apportionment of damages is not applicable to cases in which the defendant had materially contributed to indivisible injuries 46, this article therefore sees no prospect of any apportionment of damages in COVID-19 situations where practical apportionment is not feasible. 47 In other words, from both the defendant’s and the claimant’s perspective, assessment of damages for theoretically divisible yet practically indivisible diseases like COVID-19 is in no way different from diseases that are purely indivisible, both in law and in practice. Therefore, until science could advance to a point at which the cumulative nature of COVID-19 could be separated according to the progressive severity of COVID-19 symptoms in response to each successive exposure factor, a defendant who negligently transmits COVID-19 to another, absent mitigating circumstances (e. g. the claimant’s own contributory negligence), would have to bear damages to the full extent of loss endured by the claimant.   Conclusion This article has explored the potential of using the tort of negligence to establish civil liability in relation to the unintentional transmission of COVID-19. Departing from the conventional jurisprudence of other types of viral diseases, this article has argued for imposing a wide-ranging duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 on anyone who is “potentially infectious”. Nevertheless, it aims to calibrate the extent of such negligence liability through a proportionality test at the standard of care stage, balancing consideration for public health against the law’s commitment for individual autonomy. Importantly, neither the doctrine of informed consent nor that of implied consent can operate realistically in the context of COVID-19. And mask-wearing is not a measure of individual risk assessment, but rather a means of discharging the aforementioned duty of care. Lastly, although causation could be proved based on the Bonnington test of material contribution to the claimant’s disease, damages shall nonetheless be assessed without apportionment, given that COVID-19 is indivisible in practice despite being divisible by nature. Granted, the civil recourse theory48 of tort law does not imagine every COVID-19 victim to exercise their right of redress and seek the kind of legal recourse discussed in this article, save for the situations where wrongful deaths resulted from egregious instances of negligence. As a final note, the author wishes to highlight that in view of the dynamic development of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the standard of care will likely be constantly adapted in accordance with scientific development. New preventive measures, plausibly including vaccine acceptance amongst the population49, may influence what could potentially be deemed as acceptable in discharging the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19.

    "title": " 'Keep the Powder Dry': The Court of Appeal in Fearn v Tate Gallery",
    "body": "2020/09/22 - It is safe to say that the claimants in Fearn v Tate Gallery1, owners of multi-million pound, highly exclusive London flats, are not among the neediest of those who have applied to human rights law for help. However, the decision of Mann J in the High Court,2 while focusing primarily on the tort of nuisance, did raise an issue under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) of considerable importance – horizontal effect3, and the development of the common law in accordance with human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This piece will focus on this important issue, as it was dealt with on appeal by the Court of Appeal. As the Court dealt with the issue with relative brevity, focusing much of its analysis on the question of tort law outlined below, this piece will use the decision as a springboard for analysing more broadly the process by which horizontal effect is created under the HRA. In doing so, it will also serve as a response to a prior case note published on this forum, written by Thomas Yeon on the High Court decision in Fearn. 4 Contrary to Yeon, who supports the High Court’s approach to the issue, this piece will argue that the approach of Mann J left a great deal to be desired, and that the decision of the Court of Appeal is to be commended, as a welcome reassertion of a preferable approach to horizontal effect under the HRA. Having first set out the distinction in approach between the two courts, it will argue that the approach of the Court of Appeal is preferable for two reasons. The first is that it is far more consistent with past authorities, including a number of well-known Supreme Court decisions on horizontal effect. The second is that it is also far more consistent with a more normative, but no less critical, element of HRA jurisprudence, best expressed as ‘keeping the powder dry’. Court of Appeal DecisionIn order to understand the importance of the Court of Appeal’s decision on the HRA point, it is necessary briefly to re-examine the approach taken by Mann J at first instance. The facts of the case are, in fact, relatively straightforward. The claimants resided in a block of flats on the south side of the River Thames known as ‘Neo Bankside’, much of which was built from large glass panels. The result of this was that visitors to the nearby Tate Modern viewing gallery had a near-unimpeded view into the flats, and, according to the claimants, frequently used binoculars to get a better view, or even took photos which later emerged on social media. At its barest, the question facing both courts was the same – whether the tort of nuisance is capable of covering ‘overlooking’, and if it is not, whether the HRA makes any difference to that conclusion. Mann J held that the tort did cover overlooking, finding enough in the seminal decision in Hunter v Canary Wharf5 to support his conclusion. However, at paragraph 170, he then went on to hold that, “if there were any doubt about that, then in my view, that doubt has been removed by the Human Rights Act 1998 and Article 8. ” In essence, Mann J’s conclusion was that English tort law most likely already covered the facts before him, but that if he was wrong about that, Article 86 certainly covered them, and a combination of the two would produce the unassailable conclusion that the claimants had a good claim. 7 This process, in Mann J’s view, was the correct approach to take when developing the common law in line with human rights claims, as courts must do in order to comply with their obligations under Section 6(3)(a) HRA. 8 The Court of Appeal disagreed on more or less every level, with the exception of the ultimate result. On the tort law question, the Court found that the “overwhelming weight of judicial authority” pointed against Mann J’s conclusion that English law covered ‘overlooking’. 9 However, more importantly for present purposes, the Court of Appeal held that there were “a number of errors of principle” with the manner in which Mann J had approached the HRA question. They held that the correct manner in which to approach the obligations thrust upon a court by Section 6(3)(a) was a strict three-stage test: first asking if English law covers the situation, then if the ECHR covers it, then, finally, whether it is “appropriate” to extend English common law to cover the situation at hand. 10 On the facts before them, the Court concluded that, while there was a mismatch between English law and the ECHR, it was not “appropriate” to extend the tort of negligence to remedy this, as to do so would “significantly distort the tort in some important respects. ”11 Thus, although for dramatically different reasons, the claimants lost again. Consistency I: Past AuthoritiesThe problem with Mann J’s approach can be summarised very succinctly – he viewed Section 6(3)(a) as requiring him to use human rights arguments as a ‘top-up’, if the arguments under English law were not quite sufficient to get the claimants over the line and create a successful claim. Rather than viewing the English law question and the ECHR question independently, Mann J inelegantly conflated the two, holding that the arguments under Hunter had provided the claimants with a case that was almost watertight, and the remaining uncertainties could be mopped up by deploying Article 8. Yeon argues, in his piece, that this approach is the “correct and appropriately restrained” approach to take as regards the obligations of courts under Section 6(3)(a). In this section, it will be argued that, contrary to Yeon’s argument, this approach was totally inconsistent with past authorities, and that the Court of Appeal’s approach was correct. Yeon cites, as authority for what he calls the “correct and appropriately restrained judicial approach” of Mann J, the oft-quoted judgment of Baroness Hale in Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers. 12 In particular, Yeon cites paragraph 132, in which Baroness Hale confirmed the developing interpretation of Section 6(3)(a), namely that it does not require courts to create any new causes of action between private parties, but instead to develop the common law compatibly with ECHR principles. The correctness of this approach is indisputable, but Yeon fails to appreciate that Campbell only assists so far with the question in Fearn. It stands for the principle that courts should confine themselves to developing the common law rather than remaking it, but Baroness Hale does not express any opinion on the specific approach a court should take when so doing. Thus, Campbell is certainly authority for the proposition that Mann J could not have simply applied Article 8 as if it were itself a tort, and should instead have considered incorporating the provisions of Article 8 into English law. However, it is not authority for anything as regards when or how this incorporation should take place. Put more straightforwardly, Campbell speaks only to the broad-brush approach courts should take in interpreting Section 6(3)(a), it does not deal with the specifics of doing so. More is therefore required to assess the validity of Mann J’s approach. Authority on the manner in which the obligation cited in Campbell should be implemented abounds. For clarity, it is important to distinguish this line of authority from that which Jonathan Morgan quite correctly terms ‘equivocal’ – “what the HRA requires of a court faced with a “horizontal” human rights claim” as a substantive matter is, indeed, somewhat unclear, but the procedure under which they should arrive at a determination of “what the HRA requires” is not. 13 Perhaps the clearest example comes from the Supreme Court decision in A v BBC14, particularly paragraph 57 of Lord Reed’s judgment. There, the now President of the Supreme Court confirmed that, in the context of Section 6(3)(a), “the starting point” is always domestic law, in this case, the “domestic principle of open justice”. Only once this has been assessed, he went on to say, should the question of Convention rights emerge, and only then should “the capacity of the common law to develop”become relevant. 15  On the facts of the case, Lord Reed was not required to go beyond the first of the three questions, holding the long-standing principle of open justice to be sufficient, but the decision is nonetheless important for its clarity as regards the process to be followed under Section 6(3)(a). It is clear that this approach is that taken by the Court of Appeal in Fearn, not by Mann J – the three questions must be strictly delineated, and it is impermissible to ‘top-up’ a domestic law argument with human rights considerations as a result. A can count itself as part of a long line of authority to this effect, with Lord Reed citing a seven-Justice Supreme Court to the same effect in Kennedy v Charity Commission16 as one example. Indeed, the incorrectness of Mann J’s approach was actually confirmed yet again by the Supreme Court on the very same morning that the Court of Appeal decision in Fearn was handed down, in R (Jalloh) v Home Secretary. 17 In the very first paragraph of her judgment, Baroness Hale clarified her own words in Campbell, although this time in the context of Article 5 ECHR, and the tort of false imprisonment. With characteristic clarity, Baroness Hale wrote that “this case is about the meaning of imprisonment at common law and whether it should, or should not, now be aligned with the concept of deprivation of liberty in Article 5 of the ECHR”. It is crystal clear, therefore, that the approach taken by Mann J in Fearn was wrong as a matter of authority. To borrow the Court of Appeal’s phrase, “the overwhelming weight of judicial authority” falls in favour of the three-step approach they advocated, and against the ‘topping-up’ approach Mann J, perhaps unwittingly, applied. To the extent that Yeon suggested otherwise, his argument is untenable as a matter of basic precedent, and Campbell provides little more than umbrella-level guidance on a much more technical issue. Consistency II: Keeping the Powder DryYeon’s argument is not just untenable as a matter of precedent, however. It is submitted here that the reverse approach taken by the Court of Appeal is to be immeasurably preferred as the “correct and appropriately restrained judicial approach” more generally. By contrast, Mann J’s approach should, with respect, be cast away as potentially dangerous and unprincipled. This is so for three reasons, which can essentially be summarised as a failure to respect the utility of ‘keeping the powder dry’ – failure to respect the sheer power of the HRA, and the enormous value that is therefore inherent in only deploying it when necessary, and on some occasions, leaving domestic law to do its job. First and foremost, Mann J’s approach in Fearn stands firmly at odds with the approach taken to Section 6(3)(a) overall, aside from the question of strict precedent. The debate as to the proper interpretation of the Section has, since before it was enacted, been firmly bookended by two diametrically opposite positions. At one end is the view of Sir William Wade, who predicted that the Section could be immensely powerful. 18 More specifically, his view was that the Section had the power to “transform” or outright “abolish” the common law. At the other end entirely is the view of, inter alia, Sir Richard Buxton, who argued, extrajudicially, that the proper role of human rights was to regulate the relationship between state and citizen, and that the Section should be read very narrowly to reflect this. 19 English law has settled firmly for a middle-ground between the two20 – Wade’s conception of post-HRA law is simply too extreme to have been what Parliament intended (or at the very least, a change as radical as effectively creating a tort of ‘breach of human rights’ would need language far more explicit than that present in Section 6(3)(a)). Buxton’s view, on the other hand, unnecessarily emasculates human rights law by shutting off its power from a vast swathe of legal disputes in which it could justifiably be of use, and in any case, presents a narrower view of the discipline than that to which the European Court of Human Rights subscribes. 21 In striking this middle ground, English law has recognised the value of ‘keeping the powder dry’, by limiting the power of the HRA, and ensuring it is not over-applied. Mann J’s approach presents an application of Section 6(3)(a) that is far too close to Wade’s view. The idea that the ECHR can be used to ‘top-up’ or ‘fill in the gaps’ for slightly defective domestic common law arguments suggests the HRA has created a kind of human rights ‘background radiation’ – a general ether of powerful legal principle that judges can call upon at will to expand the reach of the common law. This is certainly a “transformation” of the common law, as Wade warned, and thus is firmly contra the approach carefully laid down in Douglas, Campbell and many others since 2000. Secondly, it is not simply that this middle ground persists as regards Section 6(3)(a). In fact, it is an approach discernible more broadly across the Human Rights Act. There are a number of principles of HRA adjudication disclosing a palpable recognition of the power that the Act gives courts, and a concomitant reticence to deploy that power unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps the most important example of this is the judgment of Lord Reed in ANS v ML22, which concerned Section 3 HRA. Recognising the enormous power of the Section to reinterpret Parliamentary legislation, Lord Reed felt the need to reiterate the manner in which it must be deployed, namely “only where the legislation, if read and given effect according to ordinary principles, would result in a breach of the Convention rights”. 23 This is a clear example of a desire to ‘keep the powder dry’ more generally. Section 3, much like Section 6(3)(a), is an enormously powerful tool, and it is for precisely this reason that Lord Reed, exactly like the Court of Appeal in Fearn, felt the need to ensure the boundaries of its use were correctly and stringently regulated. In both cases, the courts therefore laid down a common approach, confirming that human rights arguments should not be deployed unless ordinary domestic law cannot cover the situation at hand. Thus, clearly, Mann J’s approach in Fearn does not simply go against the prevailing approach under Section 6(3)(a), it counteracts a more general desire discernible in HRA caselaw to ‘keep its powder dry’, and ensure its vast power is regulated. Thirdly, it is, of course, one thing to suggest that Mann J’s approach goes against the general trend of ‘keeping the powder dry’, but entirely another thing to suggest that he is wrong in doing so. Perhaps Wade was on to something – maybe human rights law should seek to implant itself into domestic common law as far as possible and have far greater horizontal effect than it does at present. However, it is submitted here that this is not as desirable as it might sound on the surface. The most common argument advanced in this direction is a purely constitutional one – the vast majority of the power afforded by the HRA goes to the judiciary, and the pseudo-legislative power in, among others, Sections 324 and 6(3)(a)25 has the potential, if misused, to upset the balance underpinning separation of powers. This argument is extremely powerful, but has been well-rehearsed, and there is no need to delve into it once again. Instead, it is submitted that there is an additional important reason for favouring the approach English law has of ‘keeping the powder dry’ – it ensures the immense normative power of human rights law is retained. Put simply, human rights law is at its most powerful when it is not overused. This is best demonstrated by Section 4 HRA, the power to issue declarations of incompatibility. The Section could not be clearer about the fact that it has no effect on any legislation to which it is applied as a matter of law. 26 Despite this, however, by mid-2015, twenty Section 4 declarations had been finalised, and nineteen of those had resulted directly in a change in the law. The reason for this is simple – Section 4 declarations represent a legal pronouncement that a piece of legislation is in breach of human rights, and that is a statement that carries an enormous amount of political weight. This political weight comes from the fact that human rights law has enormous normative power, which, to no small degree, comes from the scarcity and rarity of its use. 27 It is not hard to see that, if declarations of incompatibility were an everyday occurrence, they would quickly lose their effect, as the ‘shock factor’ inherent in a court pronouncing the existence of a human rights violation would quickly dissipate. The same can be said for human rights law as an overall discipline – in order for it to maintain its normative power, it must be seen as a corpus of law to which recourse is only necessary in extreme situations. Of course, no attempt is made here to suggest that Mann J’s approach would have resulted in the demise of human rights law as a discipline, and in the value of Section 4 declarations – such a conclusion would be extraordinarily melodramatic. However, it is maintained that the normative power of the HRA is a vital component of its success, and that the best way to maintain this power is to ensure it is not overused – to keep its powder dry. The Court of Appeal has recognised this in Fearn and is to be commended for so doing. ConclusionYeon’s suggestion that Mann J’s approach in the High Court in Fearn is “correct and appropriately restrained” is, it is submitted, simply not correct, either as a matter of precedent, or as a question of more general approach. As a matter of precedent, it runs contrary to established lines of authority from the highest level as regards horizontal effect under the HRA, and more generally, it goes against an established trend in HRA adjudication to ensure that, where possible, the HRA’s powder is kept dry. It is further submitted that this approach to the horizontal effect question is also defensible, for well-rehearsed but sound constitutional reasons, but also in order to ensure that the HRA’s normative power is maintained. Thus, for all these reasons, the approach of the Court of Appeal in Fearn is to be commended, as consistent, principled and, above all, restrained. [1] [2020] EWCA Civ 104. [2] [2019] EWHC 246 (Ch).

    "title": "A Tale of Two Communities: Inequality and the Right to Water in Hudorovič and Others v Slovenia",
    "body": "2020/08/28 - A case note on Hudorovič and Others v SloveniaIntroductionHudorovič and Others v Slovenia1 is a case concerning Roma communities living in informal settlements who did not have adequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This case was fought in the context of Slovenia making the right to drinking water a constitutional right. 2 This, however, did not become pertinent,3 and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found no violation of Article 84 by a 5:2 majority in the first application, and unanimously found no violations under the other Articles and for the second application. This case note critically analyses three themes in the judgment. First, it evaluates the Court’s assessment of the right to water, contrasting it with Indian constitutional jurisprudence, and the framework proposed by the dissenting judges. It further proposes a qualified right to water in European human rights law. Second, it argues that the majority decontextualized the position of the applicants in determining socio-economic issues. They ignored the history of social exclusion and inequality faced by the Roma people and the role of the state in addressing this, contrary to the concepts of substantive equality and positive obligations. This makes this case a ‘tale of two communities’. Finally, it notes the overarching theme of socio-economic rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), examining how the nature of the application in Hudorovič is difficult to fit within traditional European human rights law, and explains the tensions that emerge as a result.   Before delving into the analysis, a brief summary of the facts is helpful. The first applicant and his son (the second applicant) in the first application lived in the informal Roma settlement of Goriča vas. Their hut had no access to water, sewage and sanitation because permits and documents could not be acquired to obtain access to public infrastructure, due to the irregular manner of establishing settlement. In the second application, a family of fourteen lived in an illegally built hut in an informal Roma settlement at Dobruška without access to water, sanitation or electricity. The applicants in both applications received monthly social assistance from the government. The applications were joined by the Court in light of the facts and substantive questions they raised. They argued violations of Articles 35, 8 and 146 of the Convention, alleging that their homes did not have access to basic public utilities and that they had been subjected to a negative and discriminatory attitude by local authorities. The opinion of the majority and the dissenting judges will be examined in the sections below.   Human right to water?The first issue this piece discusses is whether there is a ‘right to water’ in European human rights law. It is submitted that the Court unduly limited the right, if recognising it at all. The majority opined that there must be a threshold of severity in assessing whether a lack of access to water and sanitation can constitute an interference with Article 8. Consequently, it held that ‘access to safe drinking water is not, as such, a right’,7 but that a ‘persistent and long-standing lack of access to safe drinking water can … have adverse consequences for health and human dignity effectively eroding the core of private life and the enjoyment of a home within the meaning of Article 8’. 8 This standard is notably problematic. First, it sets a high threshold with multiple components, such as the persistence and long-standing nature of the lack of access, which is complicated and may be challenging to prove. Second, the test is uncertain and ambiguous. It is unclear what the core of private life is in this case and what factors would erode it. A threat to survival would undeniably be included, but the boundary becomes blurry after that, especially when concepts such as human dignity and private life are involved, the meanings of which reasonable people may disagree on. This leads to uncertainty about whether an applicant is protected by the Convention at all and could also lead to demarcations which may cause some injustice based on who may fall outside the standard, and thus be without protection. Third, it is not clear what is gained by categorically rejecting a right to water. Following the Court’s jurisprudence on qualified rights, a right to water may have been recognised and limited in the public interest, such as the prevailing socio-economic circumstances, leading to no violation. On the other hand, to say that there is no prima facie right places the burden on the already disadvantaged applicant to prove why she should have the right, instead of requiring the state to outline why the right was not fulfilled. Thus, a consequentialist approach (focusing on the consequences of the act e. g. health concerns) further erodes human rights, which a deontological approach (based on the intrinsic value of the right to water) does not. Contrast the majority’s approach with Indian jurisprudence, which has taken a different approach to the same question. The Indian Supreme Court acknowledged that there is a right to water guaranteed by Article 21 (right to life) of the Indian Constitution. 9 Since water is essential for human life to exist (in the Indian context), the much broader concept of private life (in European human rights jurisprudence), which essentially concerns itself with the quality of life,10 should include it as well. Additionally, it is worth noting that the usual constraints based on resource allocation are even more severe in a developing country such as India, so the weight attached to these arguments, at least for some countries in Europe, needs to be revaluated when balancing them against the right to a basic necessity. Even if these become critical factors for some states, they can be balanced at the proportionality stage, while still acknowledging that water is a right and not a privilege.   The partially dissenting opinion (Judge Pavli joined by Judge Kūris) proposed a middle ground between the majority’s standard and the one proposed above, under which it would be sufficient to prove adverse consequences stemming from lack of access for an extended period. However, this leads to the issues highlighted above, related to proving consequences and their graveness, since the applicant would have to prove that there were harmful effects on their dignity, for instance, and that these were caused by a lack of access to water for an extended period. This second limb not only requires proving causation, but also the temporal aspect of the persistence of the deprivation. Due to these difficulties, the prima facie right model is a better framework, as it would require a presumption of the adverse consequences and the state would then have to justify these. The dissenting opinion did allude to this subsequently, noting that ‘[s]uch a right cannot, of course, be absolute’11, and consequently noted that this predicament ‘adversely affects core private life interests and basic human dignity,’12 by definition closer to the prima facie right model explained above. Thus, the model of starting with a qualified right to water and then addressing situations in which it may be limited is better suited to tackling these issues, which the majority’s opinion fails to acknowledge, but one reading of the minority opinion hints at.   Social exclusion and inequalityThe second theme in the judgment is a lack of sensitivity to context i. e. the social position of the Roma community, generally and in this particular case. The Court had earlier acknowledged in Winterstein and Others v France13 that the Roma constitute a vulnerable minority, and that states ought to pay special consideration towards their needs. In spite of this, the majority in Hudorovič used the wide margin of appreciation in socio-economic matters to decontextualize their plight. Thus, once it was satisfied that Slovenia had made some efforts to realise its positive obligations, it did not ask whether this framework for providing access to utilities reached the marginalised. This is not to say that the Court should not defer to policy judgements of elected national representatives, but that it should assess the differential impact that a policy may have and whether the state is taking effective steps to mitigate that.   This can be seen in three aspects of the judgment which at best ignore and at worst legitimise the discrimination faced by the applicants, albeit unintentionally. First, the judgment individualised a public good by noting that the state can reasonably leave installation of connections to the expense of individuals. This fails to acknowledge the disadvantaged position that many individuals (or communities) may be in, exacerbated by social exclusion. It is submitted that even if this can be the system for the majority, having positive obligations means that the state should at least assist those who do not have adequate means. Second, it was emphasised that the applicants were receiving social benefits, which could be used to improve their conditions. However, there was no assessment of whether these would cover this infrastructural investment, since social benefits aim to aid daily expenditure. Third, the Court noted other efforts, such as water tank deliveries, made by the state to ensure access ‘irrespective of how and whether it was realised’ in its assessment of Article 3. 14 However, the minority pointed out the findings of independent expert missions which practically unanimously said that water tank deliveries were inadequate. 15 It is unclear why making any effort was seen as an end in itself, when the goal was to ensure access for the community. Therefore, whether social security benefits and other policies were effective in ensuring the right to water or whether the applicants could in reality take matters into their own hands was never critically examined. Finally, also noteworthy in the judgment is the lack of attention paid to the bigger picture, i. e. unequal social relations. The Human Rights Centre of the University of Ghent16 noted that ‘forms of unequal treatment in Slovenia included preferential treatment of non-Roma in the development of infrastructure and the systemic failure to develop infrastructure in Roma communities. ’17 Moreover, issues related to water and sanitation can not only be a form of discrimination, but also perpetuate discrimination. Unsanitary living conditions can lead to stigmatisation of a historically disadvantaged community and further alienate them from the majority. In light of this, it is questionable why the Court did not examine the Article 14 claim separately. What the applicants claimed was not merely a lack of access to water, but differential access, based on them belonging to the Roma community. The majority instead noted that access to sanitation facilities was limited in Slovenia, even in the majority areas, to absolve the state of its obligation to extend facilities to a marginalised community. This was exacerbated by an emphasis on the illegality of their housing, which meant that the state could forsake its positive obligations. This has rightly been criticised as an ‘overly formalistic approach’18 and the minority too criticised this eloquently: “[T]here is nothing objectionable about a State seeking to discourage illegal constructions and preserve public order by legally restricting their access to public utilities. However, in the specific context of Roma communities … the legality argument has been repeatedly rejected by this Court …“19 The minority also explicitly acknowledged the acts of ‘less-than-friendly’ local authorities. 20 This alludes to direct discrimination, a claim made by the applicants themselves, who argued that the state had failed to consider their needs as members of a disadvantaged group, indicated by discriminatory attitudes, prejudice and stereotypes of local authorities. 21 Thus, it is important to focus on the historical context to closely scrutinise the applicants’ claims, but in the majority opinion it seemed as though the role of the state in discrimination against Roma communities was not only ignored, but also inadvertently legitimised by focusing on formalism and uncritically accepting any policy effort.   Socio-economic rights and the ConventionThe ECHR, a product of the post-war period, ‘focuses almost entirely on the traditional canon of civil and political rights,’22 even purposefully omitting socio-economic rights. 23 However, the Court’s case law has laid down the foundation for socio-economic rights as complementing the Convention. 24 Contrary to being unfaithful to the text, this is a means of ensuring that the Convention remains dynamic and evolves with changing times, such as the inclusion of rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which found no mention in the original text. Yet this chasm between text and jurisprudence leads to certain tensions. For instance, the Article 14 jurisprudence has been criticised for being formalistic. 25 This can be seen in the present case too. A wide margin of appreciation led to minimal examination of the claims the state was making about its infrastructure, which means deference to executive authorities. Subsequently, an ahistorical assessment meant that factors such as the illegality of the housing were taken into account, an instance of the underlying formalism in Hudorovič (see above). In spite of this critique, an examination of Article 14 was crucial in this case for reasons explained previously (i. e. the unequal distribution of public utilities).   Others have argued that there is also an inherent bias in the Court’s Article 8 jurisprudence, towards negative interference instead of positive obligations associated with socio-economic rights. 26 While the Court has produced some path-breaking judgments on positive obligations in the past, this critique finds some support in Hudorovič. The traditional role of Article 8 was to prevent adverse state action and not to mandate it to do something, the classic distinction drawn between negative and positive rights. Thus, there is some hesitation in examining the state’s current efforts and legally mandating it to do more in the judgment, which would require significant infrastructural investment. Another tension can also be seen in balancing the role of judges and the government,27 which invites the criticism of deference made above, but also raises questions about the limits of the law and judicial expertise. For instance, to what extent can a court assess the budgetary allocations the state must make in order to fulfil its legal obligation of providing public utilities? Hence, there is some reluctance to find socio-economic rights as coming within the protection of private and family life. 28 Ultimately, Hudorovič was about social inequality. In side-stepping that, the judgment shows the uneasy position of socio-economic rights in European human rights law. The dissenting opinion captures the crux of the issue perfectly: If one looks beyond formalities, the case of the first applicants from Goriča vas is ultimately a tale of two communities, one Roma and one belonging to the majority, living a stone’s throw from each other – one of them has running water coming out of their taps, and the other has never had it at all for over thirty years. This in a country with an annual GDP per capita upwards of 20,000 euros. 29 One may argue that remaining faithful to the original text is more important than its judge-led evolution, and the tensions noted above only reinforce that. However, the context in which cases are argued in front of the Strasbourg Court has changed considerably since the Second World War, and as state action into the lives of individuals and communities increases, so does its obligations and responsibilities,30 especially towards those who have historically been at the margins of European society. To turn a blind eye to what some may call ‘state-sanctioned’ poverty’,31 is as much a human rights violation as any other. This judgment, unfortunately, does nothing to recognise that, and the consequence of that is upholding an unequal status quo: “The finding of no violation by the majority … will contribute little, I fear, to alleviating the plight of inequality and disadvantage that many European Roma continue to face. ”32 Concluding remarksThis case note has examined the tensions in the case of Hudorovič and Others v Slovenia under the umbrella of the relationship between socio-economic rights and the ECHR. It has critiqued the judgment for its failure to protect, or sufficiently protect, the right to water. It has also contextualised this right in a historically unequal society, noting that the Court did not pay adequate attention to this factual background. Finally, it located this case and others like it within a larger debate about whether and how non-traditional rights are to be enforced in European human rights law, concluding that while the jurisprudence may have its shortcomings, the cost of not recognising these rights is far too high. Since human rights law is constantly evolving and recognising new rights and rights-bearers, one can hope that the status quo would change some day.   I would like to thank Dr Sarah Trotter for her valuable comments and suggestions.

    "title": "The ECJ's Judgements on 'Gmail' and 'Skype Out': A Critical Review",
    "body": "2020/07/16 - A critical review of the ECJ’s Judgments on ‘Gmail’ and ‘Skype Out’Abstract:The Over-the-Top (OTT) services have successfully competed with “traditional” telecommunications services and disrupted the market for short messages, phone and video calls. While WhatsApp alone processed an average of over 65 billion messages per day in May 2018, this is true for “only” 22. 7 billion messages sent via SMS. The stunning success of OTT services like Gmail, Viber, Skype etc. is also due to the different regulation frameworks that apply to telecommunications services and OTT services. With its judgments on Gmail and Skype Out in June 2019 the ECJ finally clarified the legal situation,  subjecting Skype Out under telecommunications law, but not Gmail. This essay shall give a short overview on the key findings of the ECJ’s judgments, critically evaluating the argumentation of the court. I. IntroductionThe rise of the Web 2. 0, the widespread distribution of smart phones, and the development of new digital platforms have shaken many economic branches and turned a great number of business models upside down. This is especially true for the telecommunication sector where so-called “Over the Top” (OTT) services have successfully competed with “traditional” telecommunications services and disrupted the market for short messages, phone and video calls. 1 The stunning success of OTT-services like Gmail, WhatsApp, Skype etc. is due to many factors. Yet, it cannot be overlooked that the market is no “level playing field”, especially regarding  European regulation.                 When regulating these services, internet access providers (IAP) are treated differently than internet service providers (ISP). The regulatory framework of the transmission of signals is different to that of the transmission of content. This relates to the distinct roles assumed by ISPs and IAPs in the digital market. The service of an ISP is brought to the user over the open internet. ISPs usually don’t operate their own network infrastructures, but run software and, if necessary, some central servers. They provide almost all imaginable services rendered via the internet and range from chat applications and social networks (WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook) to streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube) and e-commerce platforms (ebay, Amazon, alibaba). The service of the IAPs, on the other hand, is limited to connecting the user (and often the ISPs too) to the internet. They only provide internet access and have no influence on the nature or content of the ISPs’ services. However,  IAPs are essential for ISPs as their services couldn’t be brought to the users without internet connectivity. An IAP provides individuals access to the internet, employing a range of technologies to connect users via their own network with the open internet. Larger IAP companies in the UK are, for example, Vodafone, British Telecom or Three. ISPs or “information society services”2 are subject to an array of different European directives depending on the kind of services they are offering, whereas IAPs are mainly regulated by the “Framework Directive for Electronic Communications Networks and Services” (Directive 2002/21/EC) and its related directives. These two frameworks differ significantly in their respective approaches and their levels of regulation. While the telecommunication sector has traditionally been heavily regulated, OTT services are almost not regulated at all. 3 It is, therefore, hardly surprising that one of the top priorities of the “Digital Single Markets Strategy” of the European Commission is to create “[…] the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish”. According to the European Commission, this requires “[…] the right regulatory conditions for innovation, investment, fair competition and a level playing field. ”4 In addition, regulatory authorities have repeatedly attempted to subject OTT service providers to the same regulation as “traditional” telecommunications providers by classifying them as providers of “electronic communications services” in the meaning of Art. 2 lit. c Directive 2002/21/EC. 5 As this would mean a much stricter regulation on OTT services and a significant increase in power for regulatory authorities, this matter was highly controversial until the ECJ issued  two fundamental judgements on the email service Gmail of Google6 and the VoIP service Skype Out of Skype Communications. 7 This essay shall give a short overview on the key findings of the ECJ and critically evaluate the argumentation of the court. II. Essential technical features of “Gmail” and “Skype Out”In the aforementioned cases, the ECJ adopts a functional-technical interpretation of the law. A technical understanding of the characteristics of the respective OTT service is essential. The BEREC8 describes OTT services as “a content, a service or an application that is provided to the end user over the public internet”. 9 However, as this definition refers more to the method of the provision, rather than a particular type of service, it does not yet provide any understanding of the concept. Almost any available service on the internet could then be qualified as an OTT service. 10 As this essay focuses on competitive effects of OTT services on the telecommunications industry, only those OTT services which enable individual communication over the internet and offer an alternative to “traditional” telecommunications services shall be deemed to be OTT services. The services Gmail and Skype Out differ mostly in their technical structure. Gmail provides its users with a service that enables them to send and receive emails and data over the internet. The service is based on a ‘client server architecture’. This  means that all relevant user data is processed, stored, and forwarded to other internet users over central servers. It associates the email addresses with the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the corresponding terminal device, splits the messages into data packets, and uploads them or receives them from the internet for the purposes of transmitting them to their recipients. The conveyance of signals occurs essentially over the open internet. 11 Internet access providers transmit those signals on behalf of the user as a service rendered under a service contract with the user. Skype Communications offers the Skype Out service as an additional feature of the communication software Skype.   This allows users to make calls from a terminal, where the software is installed, to a fixed or mobile telephone line using the Internet Protocol. The signal is first conveyed by an internet access provider, over the open internet, to a gateway where the further transmission is carried out by a telecommunications service provider via the PSTN. 12 For this purpose, Skype Communications has concluded an agreement with the telecommunications service provider which is also remunerated for its services. 13 III. The legal classification by the ECJThe key issue in both judgements of the ECJ is whether the service delivered by the OTT service providers “[…] consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks”. 14 The court begins in the Gmail case by emphasizing the regulatory distinction between the production of content and the transmission of content, since “[…] content and transmission [are] being covered by different measures which pursue their own specific objectives”. 15 However, what at first sight seems to be a simple and clear distinction is blurred by the court itself as it admits in the Skype Out and Gmail cases that the OTT services convey signals on electronic communications networks. Therefore, the court goes on, the service must consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals in order to be classified as an electronic communications service and this is only the case with Skype Out. In the case of Gmail, it is mainly the IAPs of the senders and recipients which convey the signals necessary for the functioning of the service. By applying a quantitative criterion in its assessment, the court follows the technology-neutral approach of the Framework Directive. 16 Yet, the distinction between the production and the transmission of content is less plausible due to the arbitrary evaluation of open terms (“wholly or mainly”) by the court. In order to substantiate its reasoning with a more objective criterion the court introduces therefore the concept of responsibility. The decisive factor is according to the court whether the provider is ultimately responsible to the user for the proper functioning of the service. The court states in both cases that “[…] all that matters […] is that that the provider is responsible vis-à-vis the end-users for transmission of the signal”. 17 Whilst the participation of Gmail in the sending and receiving of messages “[…] does not appear to be sufficient to [regard the service of Gmail] as consisting ‘wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals’, the court holds that Skype Communications has assumed responsibility vis-à-vis the end-users for the transmission of voice signals on the PSTN18 only by the (contractual) involvement of telecommunications service providers authorised to send and terminate calls to fixed or mobile telephone numbers via the PSTN. As a consequence, the ECJ considers only Skype Out to be an ‘electronic communications service’, while Gmail remains unregulated by the Framework Directive. IV. Critical evaluationThe findings of the court are noteworthy considering the fact that Google itself owns an internet connected network infrastructure, which is also used for the purposes of the conveyance of signals for Gmail. However, this is “of no relevance to the classification of the nature of the service” for the court. 19 Yet, following the logic of the ECJ leads to very strange results. Would the court have ruled differently if Skype Communications had its own PSTN infrastructure? What if Google only rented its infrastructure? The court does not deliver any explanation on why an internet connected network infrastructure and a PSTN should be treated differently in the regulatory classification of OTT services. The strong focus on the technical architecture gives the outcome of the legal assessment a arbitrary appearance. The different classification of the two OTT service providers is even more puzzling when the fact that Skype Communications excluded, in its general terms and conditions, any liability for the transmission of signals to the end-users is taken into account. Viewed from the end-users’ perspective, only the ISP and the telecommunications service provider remain responsible for transmitting the signals. The further arguments of the court are unconvincing too. The court states, “[t]he fact that Google must be regarded as supplying electronic communications services as the operator of its own electronic communications networks […] does not mean that all the web-based services which it supplies must also be treated as electronic communications services, even though they do not consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. ”20 This argument is void, only reaffirming  in numerous words the statement of the court that it does not consider the electronic communications networks of Google in the classification of Gmail. Legal or technical arguments in this regard are nowhere to be found. Furthermore, the judgements lack  a definition to the term of “service” within the meaning of Art. 2 lit. c) Framework Directive. Many services consist of several different sub-services such as Voice over IP, messaging or communication with chatbots. If the key criterion is whether “the service” consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals, a sharp definition of what features amount to a “service” is essential. Nonetheless, the court leaves many questions unanswered in this regard. The court fails to establish clear criteria as to when a particular feature of a provider is to be regarded as a service in the meaning of the Framework Directive. Especially in the case of Skype Out, a clear outline of the term would have been desirable, as the installation of the Skype Out feature on a terminal requires the prior installation of the Skype software, which already offers an array of (sub-)services that cannot be classified as ‘electronic communications services’. 21 In the end, the judgement of the ECJ represents a missed opportunity to put things right. A teleological approach, which also takes into account the competitive substitution effect of OTT services, would have been more appropriate. Above all, the different classification is flawed as both services provide their users with classical individual communication tools. Content-related components are fading into the background or do not even exist. Both services should be treated equally. The Administrative Court of Cologne, in the lower instance, had focused on whether Gmail had “factually adopted” the signal transmission of the IAP and stated that it is the user that “gives the decisive impulse for signal transmission”. 22 The court therefore concluded that Gmail makes an essential contribution to the functioning of the telecommunication process and qualifies as an ‘electronic communications service’. 23 This approach leaves the technical particularities out of the picture and focuses on the functionalities of the Gmail service. As this legal view would subject both services - Gmail and Skype Out – equally to telecommunications regulation, it is only to be welcomed. However, the application of regulatory means and measures requires the utmost tact and sensitivity in order to maintain the inventive strength of OTT services. The challenge for authorities will be to establish a regulatory balance between data protection, consumer protection and a functioning market without stifling innovation and industry growth.

    "title": "Treaties, Peremptory Norms and International Courts: Is the Hierarchy Theory Treading Water?",
    "body": "2020/02/27 - Introduction:In its recent report, the ILC addressed two main outstanding issues relating to jus cogens norms: the existence of regional jus cogens and the possibility of an illustrative list. 1 The report concludes with draft conclusion 24, which proposes a non-exhaustive list of the “most widely recognised”2 peremptory norms, such as the prohibition of genocide and aggressive use of force. Peremptory norms are no doubt a “positive part of international law,”3 yet are still conceptualised by some as “a dramatic (or threatening) magic. ”4 The ILC’s report is perhaps an attempt to concretise jus cogens as, in Kolb’s words, an “operational concept of law”, rather than a mere extension of natural law theory or lofty ideals. This post offers the thesis that, whilst such a mission is admirable, the operation of peremptory norms as envisaged by the ‘hierarchy theory’5 remains impeded by the dominance of treaties as a source of international law. Furthermore, this seems unlikely to change in the immediate future because treaties are a primary vehicle for the enforcement of state sovereignty, which remains paramount in an international legal sphere dominated by positivist notions of state consent. The conflict is thus characterised by the dichotomy between realpolitik and international ideals. ‘Treaty’ will be used in the sense envisaged by Article 2(1)(a) VCLT – “[a]n international agreement concluded between states… and governed by international law…”. This post proceeds from the definition of ‘peremptory norm’ offered by H. R. Fabri, who characterises it as a “hierarchy (of norms) … linked in turn with the idea of safeguarding… a supposedly universal, common core of human values. ”6 Another critical feature of jus cogens norms is pointed out by Kolb, who states that such a norm “does not allow derogation”7; likewise, Ragazzi highlights the “disability” of States to “contract out of” a norm of jus cogens. 8 The non-conditionality of peremptory norms would seem to make their applicability a simple matter, but this is not borne out in reality for several reasons. Firstly, the article considers the treatment of peremptory norms and treaties by international courts; secondly, it considers the socio-legal importance of treaties and *jus cogens norms. The issue of the hierarchy theory, and the operation of peremptory norms versus treaties, remains important despite the large volumes of literature on the subject. If peremptory norms are to assume the role assigned to them – to protect normative ideals and prevent gross infringements of human rights – they must have practical bite. The obstacles to progression must therefore be recognised in order to be overcome. There is otherwise the danger that peremptory norms become merely a theoretical ideal. 1) Courts and the Hierarchy Theory The consequences of jus cogens norms are made explicitly clear by Art. 53 VCLT 1969: “A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. ” Furthermore, Art. 64 gives retrospective application to jus cogens: “If a new peremptory norm of general international law emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates. ” This embodies the ‘hierarchy’ or ‘trumping’ argument, as expressed by Bates: jus cogens norms are to prevail over all other sources of international law, including treaties. 9 However, although jus cogens are certainly acknowledged by international courts, it is argued that they are a less favoured means of deciding cases than treaties. Crawford admits that they remain “something of a curiosity”10. Hence, “few are the instances in which a court or tribunal has applied the concept so as to determine the outcome of a case. ”11 This is a critical observation illustrated by the case of Al-Adsani. 12 In Al-Adsani, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rejected the argument that application of the doctrine of state immunity to Kuwait, under the SIA 1978, infringed his rights under Art. 3 ECHR (prohibition on torture) and Art. 6 (right to a fair trial). The applicant argued that his claim related to torture, the prohibition of which is a jus cogens norm, and hence such prohibition took “precedence over treaty law and other rules of international law”13. A majority of 9:8 held that the Art. 3 right had not been infringed: “notwithstanding” the “special character” of the prohibition of torture, the Court found itself unable to discern in the “the international instruments, judicial authorities or other materials” any basis for the applicant’s argument. 14  The case is significant because, as a treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be hierarchically subordinate to the prohibition of torture as a jus cogens norm. Thus, according to the hierarchy theory, the ECHR was the wrong yardstick by which to measure the applicant’s case. Of particular note is the centrality of multilateral treaties in the Court’s reasoning – the court noted that “none of the primary international instruments referred to (Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 2 and 4 of the UN Convention) relates to civil proceedings or to State immunity. ”15 This is illuminating as it suggests that the ‘hierarchy’ envisaged by the VCLT 1969 is not being enforced at the judicial level. If the hierarchy model is correct, the jus cogens prohibition of torture should have taken clear precedence, such that recourse to the aforementioned treaties would be irrelevant. If peremptory norms are at the apex of the hierarchy, why mention treaties at all? Furthermore, the Court referred to the ILC’s 1999 Report on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property. 16 Citing the working group’s findings, it noted that whilst some states had shown “some sympathy” for the idea that state immunity should be waived where it conflicted with peremptory norms, “in most cases… the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded. ”17 The Concurring Opinion of Judge Pellonpää joined by Sir Nicolas Bratza is also illuminating: “Although giving absolute priority to the prohibition of torture may at first sight seem very “progressive”, a more careful consideration tends to confirm that such a step would also run the risk of proving a sort of “Pyrrhic victory”. International cooperation, including cooperation with a view to eradicating the vice of torture, presupposes the continuing existence of certain elements of a basic framework for the conduct of international relations. ”18 This suggests a certain judicial reticence in developing international law beyond what is accepted by states. The Court’s reasoning appears to be driven by two main considerations: i) the lack of state practice in waiving state immunity in favour of jus cogens norms; ii) the centrality of state immunity in diplomatic relations between states, and the policy implications of impeding such immunity. This is clearly at odds with the functionality envisaged by the ILC report, which requires jus cogens to ‘trump’ treaties in order to fulfil their role of safeguarding human rights considerations. It may be argued that the hierarchical concept of jus cogens was nevertheless acknowledged in the Al-Adsani judgment: the Joint Dissenting Opinion considered that “the basic characteristic of a jus cogens rule is that, as a source of law in the now vertical international legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same status. ”19 Thus, the hierarchy theory is acknowledged by at least some amongst the judiciary. However, this does not convince as a counterargument. As Bates points out, jus cogens “only really featured in the reasoning of the minority, with the majority taking their stand on different reasoning. ”20 This post has already illustrated how the reasoning of the majority centred around multilateral treaties and policy considerations. Moreover, Bates persuasively suggests that this is not merely an outlier amidst a sea of acceptance of the hierarchy theory: he cites the Arrest Warrant Case21 as illustration of the fact that “a jus cogens norm did not automatically make ineffective other rules of international law. ”22 Both the Arrest Warrant Case and the case of Jones23 are examples of rulings in which claims to state immunity were upheld despite suspected violations of jus cogens norms. In Jones, the House of Lords upheld Saudi Arabia’s claim to state immunity despite the applicants’ allegations of torture at the hands of Saudi officials. This “hammered another nail in the coffin”24 of the hierarchy theory, and indeed it submitted that the theory is currently treading water. Whether it will remain so in the future is beyond the scope of this post. A final possible counter-argument against this state of affairs may be found in the argument of Cassese, who suggests that no “consistent practice”25 of jus cogens norm by states is necessary to render them operational; it is sufficient for members of the international community to “evince” acceptance of the norm. The rejection of ‘consistent practice’ as the benchmark of recognition would seem to imply that any statement by a state indicating acceptance of a norm as jus cogens would do. The implications of this argument are thus that enforcement of the hierarchy theory by courts is neither here nor there: jus cogens are operational, whether or not this is reflected in practice. This is superficially attractive as an argument: it seems to adhere to the intuition that the highest human rights ideals, such as prohibition of genocide and torture, should not depend for their existence on the whims of States or courts. For example, it is not seriously contested that prohibition of torture is a jus cogens norm, even though States have and do torture individuals. However, Cassese ultimately provides the correct answer to the wrong question. “Most” international lawyers accept the existence of jus cogens and also accept their “operation” within a system of international law, as pointed out by O’Connell. 26 What this post questions about, however, is the practical operation of jus cogens vis-à-vis treaties. In this sense, Cassese is over-idealistic. The idea that peremptory norms trump all other sources of international law is a hollow statement if courts reject the hierarchy in the first place. According greater importance to treaties becomes an easier way of ensuring that the development of international law does not too often outpace what is accepted by states (since treaties, by definition, are built around the intentions of the parties). Lord Lloyd-Jones concurs with the approach in Al-Adsani: there is a need for “judicial restraint in developing international law beyond what is accepted by States. ”27 Cassese himself acknowledges the lack of ‘bite’ of jus cogens: it has “never had the effect proper to the notion,”28 i. e. , to nullify a treaty contrary to its content. Cassese conversely posits that jus cogens have “perhaps”29 fulfilled a deterring role by forestalling the conclusion of agreements contrary to peremptory norms, and thus cannot be characterised as a “flop”. However, this is firstly very difficult to prove beyond doubt, and secondly, as seen by the examples given in section 2), States can and do enter into and revoke treaty obligations even if this will have a deprecative effect on jus cogens norms (for example, the withdrawal from a treaty designed to impede aggression and/or use of nuclear weapons). 30 It is ultimately difficult to reconcile Cassese’ faith in the theoretical success of jus cogens with the practice of states and courts. The explanation for jus cogen’s lack of bite is helpfully spelled out by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, as referenced by O’Connell. 31 This stated that: “… the only method of deriving [jus cogens] [is] judicial determination. Thus, it [is] left to the judge to extract jus cogens limitations from the legal system as a whole…“32 Hence, the ‘hierarchy theory’, despite its embodiment in Arts. 53 and 64 VCLT, appears to have been declawed by the Courts. Peremptory norms may not depend on state practice for their existence but, in realistic terms, they depend on judicial enforcement for their operation as the ‘trump cards’ of international law. It is submitted that this will significantly impede the fulfilment, in practice, of Kolb’s conception of jus cogens as an “operational concept of law”. Deprived of a bite, jus cogens cede their position in the normative hierarchy of international law to treaties. 2) Jus Cogens as new international law?On a final note, this article turns to the argument that jus cogens will supersede treaties as a source of international law because they are representative of a ‘new’ international order, in which human rights concerns prevail. Cassese aptly summarises this position: jus cogens are a “hallmark” of the “new international community” – for the first time, peremptory norms restrain the “hitherto unlimited lawmaking power of states. ”33 They thus represent a “novel approach” to international relations in which “community concerns”, to some extent, prevail over States’ self-interest. The inference is that peremptory norms are the better means of delivering outcomes which adhere to international human rights standards, whilst treaties are somewhat outmoded because they promote state or party sovereignty. There is the potential for discussion on this point which far exceeds the scope of this post. Nonetheless, it is sufficient for our purposes to briefly point out that this argument falls into the familiar trap of over-simplification. It is true that jus cogens represents an inroad into ‘traditional’ sources of international law, insofar as they are normative safeguards of the most basic human rights. However, it is a mistake to suppose that i) treaties are no longer ‘contemporary’, or that ii) there is no overlap in normative function between treaties and jus cogens – treaties can also play a role in safeguarding human rights. International law is “shaped and constrained” by the “norms” of international society,34 but this is not the exclusive purview of jus cogens alone. Recent developments are an apt reminder of the prevalence of treaties as a source of international obligations. In 2017, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. 35 Stalled negotiations between the EU and Switzerland over a treaty have disrupted “cross-border share trading and strained bilateral ties. ”36 As of August 2nd, 2019, the US formally withdrew from the 1987 INF Treaty. 37 Treaties, rather than jus cogens, still form the blueprint for many international agreements and developments. Treaties concretise the intentions of states and, thus, reaffirm state sovereignty. This is not a function which can be overtaken by peremptory norms as these are not concerned with States’ self-interest. This is nonetheless not to say that the two share some roles; notably, their  mutual capacity to safeguard normative ideals. In her May 2019 lecture at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, Leila Sadat38 dealt extensively with the role of the Rome Statute in establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the challenges posed to the Treaty by protectionist State policies. This serves as a pertinent example of a treaty which, in establishing the ICC, performed a human rights function in ensuring a mechanism by which perpetrators of the worst abuses could be brought to justice. Admittedly, however, the need to remain vigilant as to the implications of realpolitik and state practice remains: for example, US National Security Advisor John Bolton has previously attacked the ICC,39 potentially undermining the work of the court in enforcing jus cogens norms in relation to crimes against humanity. The US is also not a State Party to the Rome Statute, despite its ratification by many other States. Politics has the potential to outflank legality insofar as state sovereignty remains decisive. Thus, the problem of less-than-ideal political realities in enforcing jus cogens is not fully satisfied either by a reliance solely on treaties or solely on courts. Nonetheless, the power of treaties as a source of international law remains strong because they are a convenient means of safeguarding the interests of individual states. Peremptory norms often do not have this advantage, unless they happen to be embedded in treaties which provide some service to the interests of states: for example, Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the “threat or use of force” against the “territorial integrity or political independence” of any State. This embodies the peremptory norm against aggression or use of force. However, it is also beneficial to states insofar as it provides some protection for their territorial and political sovereignty. In sum, it is perhaps a disservice to peremptory norms to compartmentalise them wholly from treaties. If jus cogens are to be effective, they must represent concrete action as well as lofty ideals. This is best understood when it is recognised that jus cogens are merely one route to a common destination. Future enforcement of jus cogens may, in theory, be made more effective by a flexible approach which considers treaties and jus cogens (especially where a treaty purports to represent jus cogens) in tandem. Unfortunately, the discussion of the Al-Adsani case in section 1) above demonstrates the judicial tendency to consider jus cogens in isolation from treaties and to give preference to the treaties. ConclusionKolb rightly concludes that “there can be no doubt as to the necessity of the notion of jus cogens in a fully-fledged legal order whose development has moved beyond the most primitive stages…“40 Peremptory norms play a vital function in policing the normativity of international law. However, at least two significant problems have emerged from this discussion: i) peremptory norms are dependent on judicial enforcement and thus their efficacy is compromised, as the case of Al-Adsani demonstrates; ii) reliance on treaties remains a tempting alternative in cases where policy or state practice would render the enforcement of a jus cogens norm inconvenient. The cumulative effect of these issues is to remove the practical bite from Arts. 53 and 64 VCLT. Without implementation by international courts, the hierarchy argument is little more than a theoretical ideal. Hence, whilst the ILC Report is right to highlight other issues, such as the controversy over regional jus cogens, the comprehensive image of peremptory norms envisioned by the report’s draft conclusion 24 is as yet an ideal. The chasm between the archetype and the reality is something which must be resolved if peremptory norms are to keep up with treaties as a means of resolving cases in international law. Hopefully there may yet be a reconciliation of Cassese’ faith in jus cogens and political realism.

    "title": "Preliminary Analysis of Article XXI: Why the National Security Exception is an Implausible Justification for US Steel and Aluminium Tariffs on China",
    "body": "2020/02/17 - AbstractUS protectionist measures in modern history reached a new apex in 2018 when tariffs against steel and aluminium imports were announced, which particularly affected China, the state posing a sharp political and economic contrast to US. Not only did this trigger retaliatory measures but it also made the US a target of further World Trade Organisation (WTO) complaints from 9 Member States in relation to violations of the GATT articles, which promote trade liberalism. The US sought to defend itself using Article XXI’s national security exception. This article, however, purports to show that the US would not be successful in availing itself of Article XXI. The developments in the WTO Panel’s position regarding the reviewability of a nation’s measures invite greater scrutiny, posing a challenge to  US’s claim. The tariffs on steel and aluminium may be associated with a stronger national defence, hence showing an ‘essential security interest’. Furthermore, it is improbable that demonstrating a belief in the nexus between the tariffs and national defence will be a hurdle due to the low threshold of good faith. Instead, the demise of the US justification using Article XXI may be brought due to the inability of establishing that the circumstances were an ‘emergency in international relations’ and necessitated the tariffs. I) IntroductionIn the context of a rapidly globalising world, the increase in protectionist measures, including trade barriers, by nations acting independently is a step backwards and indeed “the last thing the global economy needs”. 1 The current era is marked distinctly by economic competition between the two largest economies of the world, the US and China. The anti-multilateral trade policy actions became evident right after President Trump took office and announced the withdrawal of the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). 2 However, the most blatantly protectionist measure, the subject of this article, were the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. In 2018, Trump announced that a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium would be implemented on imports from various nations including China. This was enacted using an obscure provision in US domestic law, and the breach of the international prohibition on trade restricting measures was justified on grounds of national security. 3 The American claim was that the strategic importance of steel and aluminium rendered the enforcing of tariffs crucial so that the domestic production losses were minimised and capability for supporting national industry of the metals was adequately developed for national defence and military purposes. 4 US tariffs against China caused turbulence in international trade law due to breaching the Most Favoured Nation principle of GATT Article I, according to which countries are not permitted to discriminate between their trading partners. 5 As the US and China are party to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a lower or higher tariff must be applied to imports originating from all Member States without differentiation. Therefore, in order to enact a tariff, the Trump administration invoked the strict, seldom-used national security exception of Article XXI and asserted that the context was a time of ‘emergency in international relations’. 6 This gave rise to the question of whether the national security exception could be utilised by the US, where the crisis does not occur in the context of a conventional military conflict. 7 This article seeks to demonstrate the difficulty of applying the national security exception to defend US tariffs on China within the WTO ambit of rules. The article begins by exploring the text of Article XXI and observing the impact of the Russia-Ukraine dispute on the reviewability of the US-China assertions in subjecting the dispute to greater scrutiny. It contends that although the national security exception is narrow and largely within Member State discretion, it allows for non-military, economic situations to fulfil the ‘essential security interest’ requirement. Establishing a connection between the rationale behind the measure and the essential security interest is a grey area of ascertaining the true state intention, but this problem is swiftly overcome by the low threshold of only requiring good faith action by the Member. The specific case of the US steel and aluminium tariffs may, however, fall short of demonstrating the seriousness of tensions and thus, a real ‘emergency’. Hence, it would not be covered by Article XXI, leading either to a lose-lose decision by the WTO Panel, which weakens the WTO regime, or an unrewarding settlement. II) Text of Article XXI and ReviewabilityArticle XXI of GATT reads as follows: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests i. relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; ii. relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; iii. taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or c) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. 8 Article XXI was drafted with an intention to balance various interests. It aimed to “take care of real security interests and, at the same time … limit the exception so as to prevent the adoption of protection for maintaining industries under every conceivable circumstance”. 9 It is a product of the desire to give countries enough leeway to institute measures required for security reasons and simultaneously prevent them from abusing Article XXI for advancing commercial ambitions. As such, the US tariffs bring discomfort among officials, because it appears to mix the “politics of international disputes into the legal world of trade and business” under the camouflage of national security. 10 Until April 2019, many contested and unclarified sections of Article XXI, such as reviewability, remained opaque due to its limited jurisprudence. Till then, only one Panel report had been adopted out of the seven GATT disputes regarding the security exception and the three WTO disputes which were all settled. 11 On 5 April 2019, the WTO issued its first ruling, a binding decision, on the national security exception and clarified the institution’s stance on the reviewability of the exception. The dispute arose between Russia and Ukraine due to measures taken by Russia which compelled transport going from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to follow specific routes. These were subject to additional conditions and obtaining derogations from authorities, thus constituting complete bans. 12 Ukraine complained about the breaches of GATT obligation and Russia replied by stating that the action was necessary for protecting its essential security interests. Russia’s assertion was that the Crimean events of 2014 amounted to an ‘emergency in international relations’ and threatened Russian border security. Furthermore, Russia contended that Article XXI(b)(iii) fell entirely within a Member’s remit to judge and that the WTO Panel may only acknowledge the invoking of the national security exception without examining the merits of the claim. 13 This perception of Article XXI(b)(iii) as ‘non-justiciable’ has historically been shared by the US, which has publicly stated its opposition to reviewability, and it was argued that a Member should not be prohibited from acting in a manner that it perceives as necessary for the protection of its essential interests.   The WTO Panel disagreed with the Russian perspective on reviewability. It clarified that the WTO Panel may review actions under the security exception of Article XXI(b) and that it was objectively discernible whether one of the three subparagraphs of (b) had occurred. Moreover, the ruling stated that the Panel could also review the measure itself to assess if it was truly believed that the measure was necessary for the safeguarding of the essential security interest and if the measure and the security interest are plausibly related. 14  The only assessment that rested entirely in Members’ hands and would not be objectively reviewed by the WTO was the determination of the ‘necessity’ of the measure employed for achieving national security interests. The reason the WTO decided largely in favour of reviewability was in light of the logical structure of Article XXI(b). It was interpreted that the structure of this subsection was intended to limit Member State discretion in invoking the exceptions. If the assessment as to whether the requirements of the subsection were fulfilled were left to Members, the clauses would be stripped of any practical effect. 15 In addition, it would result in Members being able to unilaterally discontinue their obligations under the GATT treaty, which would leave the impacted states unprotected and contradict the aim of WTO law to “promote the security and predictability” in trade agreements. 16 These ground-breaking findings, however, may be amended or overturned if either Russia or Ukraine appealed to the Appellate Body. 17 The rejection of the Russian and the US position on (un)reviewability could endanger the viability of the US claim of national security in justifying tariffs, because the ruling invites greater WTO scrutiny on the measures: their necessity and the plausibility of its link with national security interests. 18 The ruling reduces the possibility of exploiting the national security exception where the links between an essential security interest and the trade restriction are tenuous, or where the context or rationale is a non-emergency. 19 An entirely deferential approach to the national security exception would have also contradicted the historic search for an equilibrium between protecting security interests and preventing Members from maintaining their own industries in all circumstances. This ruling prevents Members from easily deviating from the GATT commitments and it ensures that the provision does not automatically permit everything under the sun whenever it is branded as being necessary to protect an essential national interest. 20 As the national security exception would be closely reviewed, Article XXI(b)(iii) is no longer a wildcard that could be used by nations to circumvent trade law obligations. The next part of the paper seeks to analyse if US tariffs would survive WTO’s extensive review and whether their measure could tenably be justified on the ground of national security. II) Applying the National Security ExceptionA) 'Essential Security Interest'The first aspect of the legal test under article XXI is whether there was an essential security interest at stake. 21 In the determination of whether there was an essential interest at stake, Members are afforded a large margin of appreciation. An essential security interest is an inherently stricter requirement than ‘security interests’ alone and is said to refer to “quintessential functions of the state, namely, the protection of its territory and its population from external threats, and the maintenance of law and public order internally”. 22 In past national security disputes, it has been contended on numerous occasions that “every country must be the judge in the last resort on questions relating to its own security”23 and that “each contracting party was the sole judge of what was necessary in its essential security interest”. 24 This is hardly surprising given that the text of Article XXI states that it does not prevent Members from taking action ‘which it considers’ necessary, thus highlighting the subjective nature of this assessment. The stated interest could range from government employee benefits, effective transportation of imports and exports or development of nuclear forces. 25 Therefore, a country has wide discretion to identify its essential security interests. In the context of the the US-China trade war, the US articulated that the essential security interest threatened by steel and aluminium imports from China was national defence.   It was officially stated that the quantity of steel and aluminium imports threatened domestic production sites with closures and was reducing national capacity to independently produce steel and aluminium items if a national defence emergency took place. 26 Additionally, the tariffs were imposed to encourage the preservation of the vital skills in the US economy and labour force.   Given the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in assessing whether their national security interest is threatened, it is unquestionable that the US has the discretion to state that national defence is an essential security interest. However, the more difficult question is how the state discretion is tempered, and in particular, whether the concept of an ‘essential security interest’ can sufficiently accommodate non-military and commercial situations within the intentions of the GATT drafters. Jaemin Lee argues that both ‘essential security interest’ and ‘emergency in international relations’ are sufficiently wide to encompass non-military and commercial or economic circumstances; however, the mere reference or highlighting of economic harm does not suffice. 27 As historian Paul Kennedy stated: “[T]he definition of national security cannot refer simply to military policies or to military spending alone. I think it ought to refer instead to those sources, those underpinnings of long-term national strength in the state and power of our manufacturing, investment in science and technology, of educational skills, all of which ultimately the Armed Forces and defence policy of this country have to rest upon”. 28 The only condition is that there must be an appropriate, economic justification behind the essential security interest. 29 In a case involving Sweden, many Contracting Parties were unconvinced with the Swedish contention that imports of footwear threatened national defence because Sweden did not provide any detailed economic justification. 30 In contrast, as the American notion of national security has historically been connected with maintaining a powerful national economy,31 the present case is unlikely to be considered inadequately justified or too remote. High tariffs commanded strong support in the US political history and were used during the Great Depression for strengthening the national economic security and industrial strength for national defence. 32 The US has also maintained consistent efforts in incorporating exemptions from their agreements due to economic circumstances, for instance in the Friendship Commerce and Navigation Treaties (FCN treaties). The treaty allows for derogating from national treatment obligations in a period of economic emergency. 33 These historical precedents once again illuminate the intertwinement of domestic economic health and national security, and explain why economic circumstances can and should fall within the ambit of ‘essential security interests’ for the US. Accordingly, even if the  Panel remains unconvinced about a country’s chosen matter constituting a national security interest, the selection of national interests is the sole discretion of a country and would not be amenable to WTO review if it has been adequately articulated. As mentioned above, the stated interest could range from government employee benefits, effective transportation of imports and exports or development of nuclear forces. 34 Thus, not only is it possible for an economic interest to be used discretionarily to constitute an essential security interest, but the current case of US-China also demonstrates the economic importance and relation of steel and aluminium imports to its essential security interest. B) Belief in The Measure AdoptedThe second aspect of the legal test involves ensuring a link between the measure adopted and the essential security interest. While the test of necessity of the measure is the exclusive assessment of a Member State, the Panel may investigate and ensure that the trade measure was taken with the sole rationale of promoting the essential interest. That said, Article XXI(b) requires adequate explanation which can be subject for review by the Panel only to observe if there is sufficient support of the measure being genuinely considered to promote the essential security interest. The test is thus reduced to a looser, good faith obligation. 35 In the case of the US, it would have to demonstrate that the tariffs do not have an ‘implausible’ relation with protecting the essential security interest of national defence and provide adequate reasoning to satisfy the necessity qualification. 36 As Article XXI did not specify a formal condition to satisfy the legal test and only a minimum requirement should be needed for showing connection between the measure and security interest,37 the US is unlikely to face challenges in fulfilling the lenient standard of review. The Proclamations on the introduction of steel and aluminium tariffs expressed the instrumental role played by steel and aluminium and its value for military and infrastructural purposes, which demonstrate the nation’s belief in the effectiveness of tariffs in achieving their national security interest. 38 One may argue that the imposition of tariffs was not done out of genuine belief that it was required for national defence, as the Department of Defence acknowledged that only  3% of total domestic production of steel and aluminium is needed for military purposes and that there is no current shortage of this supply. 39 However, because the WTO relies on Member cooperation and reciprocal trust, the concerns expressed in the White House proclamations could successfully fulfil the low good faith threshold.   Furthermore, the Panel’s finding in the Russia-Ukraine dispute that the Russian action was a measure genuinely taken for national security interests is in favour of finding the same for the US.  In that case, Russia had taken trade-restrictive measures which resulted in Ukraine not being able to use roads or railways, which prevented the flow of goods to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and affected the goods destined for Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 40 In light of the significant impact on its trade, Ukraine complained about the violation of the GATT treaty and the Russian Accession Protocol. However, Russia did not specifically respond to the legal arguments or factual basis for Ukraine’s complaints related to the GATT treaty nor the Russia Accession Protocol violations. In its submissions, it plainly stated that the measures were considered ‘necessary for essential security interests’ in relation to the 2014 emergency concerning the security of the Ukraine-Russia border. 41 Despite such little engagement with the allegations and the absence of a full defence on the Russian part, the Panel found that “Russia’s articulation of its essential security interests is minimally satisfactory”. Ultimately, the question was phrased as asking whether the measure was “so remote from, or unrelated to, the 2014 emergency that it is implausible that Russia implemented them for the protection of its essential security interest”. 42 On that formulation, only the most distanced and remote links between the measure and essential interest would be rejected. This indicates that even making public suggestions of enacting measures for protectionist interests would not jeopardise the country from meeting the low threshold. 43 Thus, even a counterargument that Trump made public statements highlighting that the tariffs on China were for non-essential security reasons would fail to damage the US assertion of good faith belief in the measure. The low threshold would lead to US trade measures being considered as genuinely intended for facilitating national industries.   C) 'Emergency in International Relations'The final determination that Panel must make is to decide whether one of the conditions within subparagraph (b) exist, the most relevant of which for present purposes is the state of emergency in international relations. Lacking an official definition, ‘emergency in international relations’ is one of the vaguest phrases in the article and has been interpreted in ordinary language and meaning in the context of the phrase “war or other emergency in international relations”. As ‘war’ has been referred to as a “violent struggle through the application of armed force”,44 the meaning of ‘emergency’ must be different to ‘war’ and need not reach the gravity of an armed military conflict or else the distinction would be futile. Nevertheless, an emergency must be sufficiently serious to ensure that every state that cannot demonstrate an armed conflict, does not simply rely on the phrase, ‘emergency’, to justify trade measures in a context of mild frictions. 45 The Panel in the Russia-Ukraine dispute defined an emergency in international relations as a “situation of armed conflict, or of a latent armed conflict, or of heightened tension or crisis, or of general instability engulfing or surrounding a state”. 46 Due to the political and military tensions after the Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014, the Panel was satisfied that the measures taken by Russia were during an emergency period, which gave rise to security concerns for the Ukraine-Russia border. Moreover, the UN General Assembly’s recognition of the armed conflict and absence of evidence suggesting an intention to circumvent WTO trade rules led the Panel to conclude that the minimum requirements for Article XXI(b) had been met. 47 Although ‘heightened tension or crisis’ could equate to a non-military and economic emergency, the US economic relations with China are unlikely to satisfy the ‘emergency’ requirement. In general, an economic situation, which albeit is not war but threatens causing comparable damage is capable of falling under the scope of ‘emergency’. 48 In fact, the use of the conjunction ‘or’ between ‘war’ and ‘emergency in international relations’ indicates that non-war emergencies can be equally harmful to domestic interests, especially in light of economic retaliation and cyber attacks. 49 Therefore, it appears that non-military circumstances could validly constitute ‘emergencies’ if they reach a similar level of threat.    However, based on a comparable case, the US would be unable to prove the gravity of the US-China trade war and would, therefore, fail in proving an ‘emergency’. In the arbitration proceedings of CMS against Argentina at ICSID, the emergency defence of a bilateral agreement was invoked by Argentina to justify its actions. However, even though the Argentinian economy suffered through a major economic and political crisis since the 1990s, to the extent that it enacted new laws declaring a public emergency, the tribunal found that Argentina did not meet the benchmark of ‘total’ economic collapse. 50 Although the ICSID tribunals are not binding on the WTO, the ICSID interpretation of ‘emergency’ makes for an interesting and potentially useful comparison, especially because WTO has no jurisprudence of its own on this matter. Not only is the US economic situation far less precarious than the Argentinian, but the tension between the US and China remains mainly that of political and economic differences, which as per the Panel report on Russia and Ukraine is insufficient alone for showing an emergency. As the US-China trade war is not of extreme severity and section 232 was intended as an overall economic policy tool51 instead of specifically aimed at national economic security reasons, the US-tariffs are unlikely to be considered as having arisen in an emergency context. Therefore, the US invocation of the national security exception of Article XXI is unlikely to succeed.            III) Outcome of the DisputeAlthough the foregoing analysis implies that the US would have breached WTO laws and cannot make use of the national security exception, this may not necessarily lead to a WTO finding that there has been a breach. If the dispute results in a Panel decision, it could be a ‘lose-lose’ choice. On the one hand, if the Panel lowers the threshold required for an ‘emergency in international relations’ or for other reasons finds that the US could successfully apply Article XXI’s exception, the leniency could encourage other nations to implement trade barriers under the mask of ‘essential security interest’. Not only would this damage the credibility of the WTO as a neutral institution, but it would also render the trade laws that prohibit trade restrictions nugatory. On the other hand, a Panel ruling that finds against the use of the national security justification for the US would be perceived as encroaching upon national decisions and could lead to crucial players, such as the US, withdrawing their membership from the institution. 52 It would also risk antagonising the US further, which already refused the replacements for the leaving members of the Appellate Body. This would mean that, unless the US began approving members, the Appellate Body would be paralysed in its functioning as it requires a minimum of three panellists and, without replacements, soon there may only be two panellists remaining. Due to the unfavourable consequences of having a direct confrontation through a Panel decision, it is likely that dispute resolution is reached through diplomatic or non-confrontational means, such as the position US-Nicaragua dispute ended in. In this dispute in 1985, the US effectuated a full trade embargo on exports and imports that went to or originated from Nicaragua. Nicaragua claimed that the US had violated various articles of GATT and that the national security exception could not be used arbitrarily in a context where it was challenging to believe that a country as economically and physically small as Nicaragua posed a real threat to US essential interests. 53 Although a Panel report was issued, there was no consensus and the report was ultimately not adopted. Nevertheless, the trade embargo and all sanctions were officially lifted in 1990 when US officials stated that the circumstances that created the need for the trade restriction had dissipated. 54 The US-China and US-Nicaragua dispute share similarities in both being cases where an essential non-military interest was at stake, an extreme trade measure was adopted and the context did not represent a true ‘emergency of international relations’. Given these commonalities, it is possible that a diplomatic or political solution may be the only acceptable outcome for the US-China dispute.     IV) ConclusionOverall it seems that invoking the national security exception involves a delicate balance between restricting Members from acting in protectionist manners while being permissive of deviations under the narrow condition of an endangered essential security interest. If the dispute reached the WTO Panel, the US’s use of the defence would be subject to extensive review. The essential security interest of national defence is likely to be satisfied due to Member State discretion in this field and the link between steel and aluminium and national defence. Demonstrating genuine belief in the tariffs being able to achieve a stronger national defence system would also be easily fulfilled, albeit after being subject to review, due to the low threshold. It is the final determination of whether an emergency in international relations exists which would be a blow to the US reliance on the national security exception, as this necessitates grave circumstances in the US-China trade war and the state of affairs has not yet reached that severity. The handling of the US-China trade dispute highlights the weaknesses of the WTO as an institution that relies on consensus and requires the cooperation of key economic leaders in order to be effective. Thus far, the Panel decisions, or the lack thereof, have given rise to more questions than answers, such as the degree to which the Panel will continue with almost ground-level good faith requirement where a nation gives mixed indications of its true rationale behind trade restrictions. Moreover, the application of the vague definitions of ‘emergency’ will remain largely opaque until there is further jurisprudence on Article XXI. Perhaps the clearest lesson on analysing literature and applying the Russia-Ukraine ruling to the US-China tariffs is that discussions of Article XXI(b) have only commenced and require examination in various contexts before its true shape becomes workable or clear. Suffice it to say that the national security exception is no longer a trump card.

    "title": "Protecting Rights under the Common Law: R(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - Introduction:In the case of R(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor,1 the Supreme Court ruled that the Lord Chancellor’s Fee Orders for the Employment Tribunal (ET) and the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) were unlawful because they limited access to justice. This article will first set out the background facts and context behind the appeal. Then, it will highlight the shift in focus away from EU law to the common law in the Supreme Court judgment (“Judgment”). Finally, it will analyse the Judgment and discuss the common law’s potential to protect basic rights.    Background facts:Section 42(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (‘2007 Act’) provides that the Lord Chancellor ‘may by order prescribe fees payable in respect of anything dealt with by the First-tier and Upper Tribunals or by an added tribunal. ’2 An “added tribunal” is defined by Section 42(3) as a tribunal specified in an order made by the Lord Chancellor. 3 In 2013, through an order, the ET and EAT were included as added tribunals. In July 2013, the Lord Chancellor introduced the Fee Order to make provisions for fees to be payable in respect of any claim presented to the ET and EAT. Before the Fee Order was made, access to the ETs, unlike claims in the ordinary courts, could be presented for free. The amount payable varied depending on the type of claim presented and whether it was brought by a single claimant or a group. The two types of claims are split up into “type A” and “type B” respectively. Type A claims require little to no pre-hearing work and are easy and quick to resolve. Meanwhile, type B claims generally involve more judicial time, for example equal pay claims and unfair dismissal claims. As established by the order, the fees for a single claimant was £390 for a “type A” claim and £1,200 for a “type B” claim. In the EAT, fees of £1,600 are payable. Claimants and appellants could only seek remission of fees after satisfying two criteria. First, their disposable capital must be below a specified amount. Second, if this test was satisfied, then the amount of any remission was qualified by the applicant’s gross monthly income. The threshold for access to remission varied depending on certain factors, for example: whether the claimant is single and whether they have children. The only other exception for remission was if the Lord Chancellor was satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances which justified such deviation. UNISON sought judicial review over the Fee Order scheme on the basis that it unlawfully prevented or restricted access to justice. The claim was first brought on the grounds that the Fee Order was indirectly discriminatory and breached the EU law principles of effectiveness and equivalence. 4 The Divisional Court dismissed the claim on the basis that the proceedings were premature and lacked sufficient evidence to sustain the challenge. 5 The Court of Appeal dismissed the judgment on the grounds that the imposition of a fee would not constitute an interference with the right of effective access to a tribunal under EU law unless it made it impossible in practice to access the tribunal. 6 UNISON then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court. A shift in focus:Before discussing the judgment, it is important to point out the shift in focus which the argument took as it proceeded from the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Before the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal, the issue of the Fee Order’s effect on access to justice was challenged on the basis of EU law. Before the Supreme Court, although some reference was made to EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, it was recognized that as part of the UK’s common law constitution, there was a right of access to justice. The shift in focus from EU law to common law in UNISON is an ample reminder that even with rights guaranteed from EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights, the common law remains a source of constitutional rights. When the Human Rights Act was first introduced, the sole focus from the judiciary on the European Convention on Human Rights compromised the common law’s development and ‘left it in the cupboard. ’7 Only recently have judges brought back the common law as a guarantor of basic rights. As Lord Reed illustrated in Osborn v Parole Board, which concerned the right to a fair hearing,one should not ‘suppose that because an issue falls within the ambit of a Convention guarantee, it follows that the legal analysis of the problem should begin and end with Strasbourg case law. ’8 The focus by the Court on the common law was likely deliberate. The Judgment was handed down after the UK voted to leave the European Union and amid political hostility towards the European Convention on Human Rights. It is in this context that the Judgment illuminates the common law’s potential as a guarantor of basic rights. The Supreme Court’s judgment:In order to determine the extent of the power conferred on the Lord Chancellor by the 2007 Act, the court must consider both the text of the provision and the constitutional principles that underlie the text. Lord Reed noted that there are two important principles in this case to determine whether the Fee Order was unlawful under English law. First, the constitutional right of access to justice. Second, the rule that ‘specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act. ’9 In English law, the right of access to the courts has been established since Magna Carta: ‘We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right. ’10 Applied to modern contexts, there are many examples where the judiciary has recognized the constitutional right of access to the courts, which can only be curtailed by clear statutory enactment by Parliament. As Lord Diplock remarked in Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd, ‘the due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities. ’11 In accordance with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, access to the courts should only be impeded through primary legislation from Parliament. In principle, as Lord Reed noted, it can be justified for the executive to impose fees upon litigants. The imposition of fees is desirable because it transfers away costs from the general taxpayer to those that use the system. Moreover, a price mechanism could incentivise settlement and prevent weak claims from being pursued. However, in the context of the 2007 Act, Parliament did not expressly authorise the prevention of access to the relevant employment tribunals. As such, the fees imposed can only be justified if they do not lead to a real risk that persons will effectively be prevented from having access to justice. The court held that the present fee order imposed by the Lord Chancellor was not justifiable for five reasons. First, the Review Report on the impact of the fee orders concluded that the imposition of fees resulted in a ‘sharp, substantial and sustained fall in the volume of cases. ’12 Second, the court was not comforted by the presence of the Lord Chancellor’s discretionary power of remission or by the statutory scheme. The effects of the Fee Order had occurred despite the existence of both remission avenues. The problems identified through the report and in the proceedings indicated a systemic issue. 13 Third, for low to middle income households to meet the expenses, they would need to sacrifice ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time. 14 Fourth, many claims brought in front of the ETs do not seek any financial award. The claims which do seek a financial award are generally quite modest, for example £500 for unlawful deduction of wages. If a litigant had to pay £390 in order to pursue a claim worth £500, they would only sensibly do so if they were virtually certain of success. In practice, there is never a guarantee of success when pursuing a claim. Thus, the onerous fees would ‘render it futile or irrational to bring a claim. ’15 The evidence before the court suggested that only half of the claimants who succeeded in obtaining an award received payment in full, and around a third received nothing. 16 Finally, the Lord Chancellor did not set the prices at an optimal level to maximize revenue and failed to consider the public benefits derived from the enforcement of rights before the Employment Tribunals. 17 All of the reasons above led to the conclusion that the Fee Orders effectively prevented access to justice and was therefore unlawful. Given that the Fee Order was unlawful under domestic law, the other arguments presented were dealt with very briefly in the judgment.   Discussion:On doctrinal grounds, the Judgment was reached using well-established common law principles of judicial review. The Supreme Court merely applied the test established in Hillingdon: whether the Fee Order was ultra vires depended on whether there was a ‘real risk’ that litigants would effectively be prevented from having access to the court. 18 When reviewing this judgment, it must be emphasised that in UNISON the primary legislation contained no words authorizing the prevention of access to justice. However, Lord Reed, relying on the cases of Leech19 and Daly,20 also suggested in obiter that even where primary legislation was concerned, the imposition of an intrusion on the right of access to justice is subject to a presumed implied limitation: the intrusion ‘must not be greater than is justified by the objectives which the measure is intended to serve. ’21 If this limitation was applied to primary legislation, it would appear to be a radical step in well-established principles of judicial review. As suggested by Murkens, ‘the real test would be if Parliament re-enacted the tribunal fees as an Act of Parliament. ’22 In UNISON, Leech and Daly, the judicial review challenge was not against primary legislation, but orders and rules made by the executive. Therefore, the three judicial review challenges relied upon well-established principles of judicial review against the executive. However, if the implied limitation is used in practice concerning primary legislation by Parliament, the courts would be embarking on an unprecedented step against the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.   The judgment should be applauded for the robust defence of access to the courts in maintaining the rule of law. Access to the courts is important for the rule of law because ‘without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade. ’23 The truth is that access to courts and tribunals are not just of value to individual litigants, but also to society. Every decision made by courts and tribunals contributes to the establishment of legal principles that applies to everyone. The courts and tribunals across the UK represent an avenue for litigants to enforce their rights. If a party or business fails to meet their obligation, a litigant should be able to seek a remedy against them. This ability to hold the other party to account is particularly important for relationships that are inherently unequal, such as the employer-employee relationship. In the context of employment tribunals, the mere fact that a claim can be brought by an employee will ensure that employers respect the rights provided by Parliament. If onerous fees prevent employees from making claims, employers could potentially disregard rights knowing that they will not be held to account before a court or tribunal.     Finally, the judgement demonstrates clearly the potential of the common law to protect the right of access to justice, but what about other rights? The first difficulty encountered by the common law as a guarantor of basic rights is that it lacks an established list of constitutional rights. Although, extra-judicially, Lord Cooke included among the list of common law rights: the right of access to a court and to confidential legal advice, the right to a fair trial, the right to equal treatment, and the freedoms of expression and religion;24 as illustrated by Masterman and Wheatle, there ‘remains no complete list of rights which the common law ranks as constitutional. ’25 In addition, there are some fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights that are missing from Lord Cooke’s list of common law rights.  The right to private and family life provided by Article 8 and the right to freedom of assembly and association provided by Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights are notably absent among others. The weakness of domestic judicial review in protecting rights was noted by the European Court of Human Rights in Smith and Grady v UK. In the context of Article 8, despite the ‘anxious scrutiny’ test being applied where fundamental rights were concerned, the European Court of Human Rights still felt that the threshold for the domestic approach was so high that it was unable to provide adequate protection. 26 Although UNISON demonstrates that the common law can be an adequate guarantor of the right to access of justice, it is important to note that the right being protected in UNISON has a long history of receiving strong judicial protection. Therefore, the impact of the judgment in highlighting the common law’s ability to protect all rights should not be overstated. It is regrettable that the Court did not comment on the common law’s standard of review for other fundamental rights. As a result, the common law’s ability to guarantee other rights, particularly those less well-established, remains precarious. Whether the common law can adapt and evolve to protect other rights currently recognized under the Convention will be thrust into the spotlight if the UK departs from the European Convention on Human Rights in the future.    Conclusion:The judgment in UNISON clearly displays the potential for the common law as an instrument to protect basic rights. In this aspect, it continues the narrative driven by the Court in Osborn27 and Kennedy,28 which highlighted the common law’s protection of the right to a fair hearing and the principle of open justice. In UNISON, the Supreme Court offered a robust defence of the importance of access to justice. However, the judgment leaves open two important questions. First, whether implied limitations apply to primary legislation made by Parliament. Second, despite the Supreme Court demonstrating that the common law will go to lengths to uphold the right of access to justice, it leaves open for discussion whether the common law can also be a powerful defender of other rights.

    "title": "A Bank’s Liability for a Director’s Misappropriation of Funds: Singularis Holdings Limited (in liq) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd",
    "body": "2020/01/23 - IntroductionIn the recent decision of Singularis Holdings Limited (in liq) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd,1 the Supreme Court affirmed a bank’s liability to a corporate customer for the misappropriation of funds by one of the customer’s directors for the first time. In order to contextualise the case this article will first examine the origin of this duty of care. Then, it will explain the reasoning adopted by the Court, before finally offering some views on the impact of this decision on the banking industry generally.  It concludes that although it is the first decision to impose liability on a bank for a breach of the Quincecare duty of care, it is unlikely to affect pre-existing robust banking practices to a great extent, nor to open the floodgates in practice. The Quincecare duty of careIt is a fundamental principle of banking law that “the primary duty of a paying bank is to honour its customer’s instructions and make payments as instructed in accordance with its mandate”. 2 This important principle ensures that there are no undue delays for customers accessing their bank funds. However, such a blanket rule has its drawbacks. Under this rule, if a rogue director of a company dishonestly gives the bank instructions to transfer money out of the company’s account, then the bank must do so, even if it would cause the company significant harm. To protect the interests of bank customers and third parties, the courts have developed an additional principle to safeguard against this form of fraud which imposes a reasonable standard of care on banks. 3 This principle—known as the Quincecare duty of care—arose out of a case involving a bank which had lent money to a corporate borrower. The funds were paid into the corporate borrower’s account, but the chairman of the company subsequently requested the bank to transfer a large portion of the borrowed funds to the account of a firm of solicitors that had acted for him on a previous occasion. However, those solicitors were not acting for the company at the time, but rather, were assisting the chairman to transfer all the funds away to the United States. The bank then sued the guarantor of the loan for repayment of the loan. In the course of determining whether the guarantor had any defences against the bank’s claim, Lord Steyn set out the following principle in relation to whether the bank in fact owed a duty of care to the corporate borrower not to pay out the money on the chairman’s instructions:4 “A banker must refrain from executing an order if and for as long as the banker is ‘put on inquiry’ in the sense that he has reasonable grounds (although not necessarily proof) for believing that the order is an attempt to misappropriate the funds of the company … And, the external standard of the likely perception of an ordinary prudent banker is the governing one. ” On the facts of the case, the defence failed on the basis that the bank’s conduct did not meet the threshold. The Quincecare principle appears to strike a reasonable balance between allowing the bank to process genuine transactions efficiently, and imposing some limit on the bank’s ability to do so where something is amiss. A bank is entitled to start from the assumption that a transaction is genuine and valid and that its customer is honest, and would only need to question a transaction when there is reason to do so. Examples of such circumstances include where ‘any reasonable cashier would hesitate to pay a cheque at once and refer it to his or her superior, and when any reasonable superior would hesitate to authorise payment without inquiry’;5 or where there is a ‘serious or real possibility albeit not amounting to a probability that its customer might be defrauded’. 6 However, until recently, no case against a bank for breach of its Quincecare duty of care has succeeded.  For example, in Lipkin Gorman, the bank manager knew that the partner of a law firm had a gambling problem, but still allowed that partner to empty the firm’s bank account using cheques that were only signed by that partner. Even in those circumstances, the Court ruled that imposing liability would impose a “wholly unrealistic duty” on banks to continually monitor for signs that a corporate customer’s signatory might be abusing his signing powers. 7 Accordingly, it is clear that the realities of the sheer volume of banking transactions weigh so strongly on a Court’s mind that it would only be in truly exceptional circumstances that the Court would impose liability. This gives banks a certain level of comfort that the duty of care does not require constant monitoring of all of its customers’ accounts for potentially fraudulent activity. Background to SingularisIt is in this context that the recent Supreme Court case of Singularis is of interest, being the first case to impose liability for a breach of the bank’s Quincecare duty of care. Singularis Holdings Limited was a company set up to manage the personal assets of Mr Al Sanea. Mr Al Sanea was Singularis’s sole shareholder, as well as a director and chairman. In this role, Mr Al Sanea had signing powers over the company’s bank accounts. Singularis entered into an arrangement with an investment bank called Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited. As a result of this arrangement, Daiwa eventually held a cash surplus in the account of Singularis of US$204 million. In the meantime, the bank became aware that Mr Al Sanea was in dire financial straits, with his assets having been frozen by the Saudi authorities. Within approximately a month, Mr Al Sanea gave instructions on behalf of Singularis to make eight payments totalling US$204 million to Saad Specialist Hospital Company and Saad Air, even though there was no proper basis for any of those transactions. Daiwa duly honoured those instructions without further investigation, and paid out all the money from Singularis’s account – effectively allowing Mr Al Sanea to misappropriate those funds. Mr Al Sanea then put the company into voluntary liquidation. In order to recover funds to be distributed to creditors in Singularis’s liquidation, the liquidators brought a claim against Daiwa for recovery of the amounts of the payments, based on Daiwa’s breach of the Quincecare duty of care owed to Singularis by giving effect to Mr Al Sanea’s payment instructions. The High Court ruled that in the circumstances, there was a clear breach of the Quincecare duty of care.  In doing so, it took into account the following factors: (a) Mr Al Sanea was using the funds for his own purposes and not for the purposes of benefiting Singularis;8 (b) The bank was aware of Mr Al Sanea’s and Singularis’s dire financial straits;9 (c) The bank was aware that Singularis might have other substantial creditors with an interest in the money;10 (d) The bank was put on notice that there were significant issues with the way that Mr Al Sanea was operating the Singularis account;11 (e) The bank was aware of the possibility that there was a front or a cover rather than a genuine obligation in relation to some transactions;12 and (f) There was a striking contrast between the processing of different payments, with the impugned payments often being simply signed off without consultation or discussion with anyone. 13 Based on the above factors, the Court concluded that there was a breach because: “Everyone recognised that the account needed to be closely monitored … But no one in fact exercised care or caution or monitored the account themselves and no one checked that anyone else was actually doing any exercising or monitoring either. ” 14 Daiwa appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and then to the Supreme Court. Daiwa accepted the finding that on its face, there had been a breach of the Quincecare duty of care. However, it relevantly argued that it had a defence to the claim—namely that Mr Al Sanea was Singularis’s directing mind and will, and that therefore, his fraud can be attributed to Singularis. Daiwa’s argument was that if Singularis was implicated in the fraud, then the claim against Daiwa is defeated by illegality, lack of causation, or because of an equal or opposite claim for the company’s deceit against Daiwa. 15 Supreme Court’s rulingThe Supreme Court traversed a number of previous authorities regarding attribution of a fraudulent director’s knowledge to a company.  These included: (a) Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission, where the House of Lords identified three levels of attribution: firstly, the express rules of attribution in the company’s constitution; secondly, the rules of agency and vicarious liability; and finally, if neither of these apply, based on the construction of the particular rule in relation to which attribution is required;16 (b) Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens, where the Court ruled that the fraudulent activities of the beneficial owner and directing mind and will of the company were to be attributed to the company;17 (c) Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir (No 2), which limited Stone &amp; Rolls to its facts, and has been interpreted as meaning that the dishonesty of the controlling mind in a one man company could be attributed to the company. 18 Ultimately, the Supreme Court did not specifically decide which of these three cases governed the situation here. Rather, it ruled that the guiding principle for attributing a director’s fraudulent knowledge to a company is always to be found in consideration of the context and the purpose for which the attribution is relevant. 19 In this case, the context to be considered is the Quincecare duty of care. The purpose of this duty is to protect the company against the misappropriation of funds by a trusted agent of the company who is authorised to withdraw its money from the account – that is, the very sort of misappropriation that occurred here. If in these circumstances, the fraud of the trusted agent is attributed to the company, then in practice, the Quincecare duty would be rendered redundant. Stepping back, the Supreme Court also recognised the reality that “companies are different from individuals. They have their own legal existence and personality separate from that of any of the individuals who own or run them. The shareholders own the company. They do not own its assets and a sole shareholder can steal from his own company. ”20 Accordingly, there is no reason in principle that a director’s intentions must always be attributed to the company, and this determination is highly dependent on context. Because of its conclusion on attribution, the Supreme Court did not consider further arguments regarding illegality, causation or deceit. What is the impact of this decision on banks?Since the Quincecare duty of care has existed for some 25 years without any successful cases ever having been brought against a bank, some may have considered it to be a theoretical duty since the threshold for breach is so high that it would never have any practical application. Thus, some consternation may be caused by the Supreme Court’s findings that not only could the Quincecare duty found liability against a bank, but also that a fraudulent director’s state of mind could not be attributed to the company for the purposes of this duty. There may be the view that if the courts will now impose such liability, it could cause further cases to be brought and open the floodgates. Indeed, banks may understandably query whether it is just to impose liability on the bank for the acts of a fraudulent director, given that it is the failure of the company’s corporate governance processes that has created the situation in the first place. Should the company not pay for its own failures, or seek recovery from the fraudulent director instead? However, the result reached in the case can be justified.  First, on the point of attribution, there is some artificiality in saying that the director’s fraudulent intentions should be attributed to the company when it is the company that is being defrauded. The Supreme Court’s decision simply acknowledges the reality that the intent of fraudulent directors who act outside the scope of their duties no longer act as the company. Further, from a policy perspective, as this case illustrates, often companies are unable to protect their own assets against the managing director who has control over all of its affairs—indeed, that is the very nature of one-person companies. In such circumstances, the banks who have close dealings with such a director are perhaps in the best position to assess any suspicious circumstances giving rise to a transaction, and to prevent them from occurring, rather than accepting the signatory’s suspicious actions at face value. Given that this duty and its protective purpose have now become settled law, it follows that it would be antithetical to this purpose to allow the bank to plead the defence that the rogue director’s fraud should be attributed to the company. In any event, it would be too simplistic to conclude that it is the company that would suffer the ultimate harm from the fraud if the bank is not liable. In the case of one-person companies, it is often to one director’s advantage to transfer all the funds out of the company, leaving the company as an empty shell. The company, being an empty shell, has nothing to lose—the parties that lose out are any existing creditors that would otherwise have been paid out in a liquidation. Indeed, in this case, it was Singularis’s liquidation that led to the claim being brought against the bank. In circumstances of liquidation, it is often the case that either the director can no longer be located, or even if located, he or she no longer has any assets worth pursuing. When the situation effectively becomes a choice of balancing the interests of a bank that had some power to prevent such loss, and the interests of creditors who had no power to do so, it is not surprising that the balance might be struck against the bank. Furthermore, although liability was imposed in this case, it must be remembered that generally, the courts continue to require exceptional circumstances before imposing such liability. The Quincecare duty is not so exacting that it requires banks to scrutinise every transaction to look for suspicious activity, but rather it only arises where the situation has become so obvious to the bank in its day-to-day transactions that any reasonable bank would make further inquiries. In practice, this is not very different from other existing duties that banks are required to comply with, such as reporting suspicious activity under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017. It simply requires banks to have in place procedures that would allow a rogue signatory’s fraud to be treated as suspicious activity and inquired into further procedures that one would expect to already be in place. Accordingly, although Singularis is the first decision ever to impose liability for a breach of the Quincecare duty of care, it is the author’s opinion that it is a sound decision that merely affirms that banks must take care when honouring its customer’s mandate in situations that raise suspicions as to the signatory’s true authority. It is unlikely in practice to affect pre-existing robust banking practices to a great extent, nor to open the floodgates.

    "title": "The Grossly Undefined Threshold for Establishing Medical Manslaughter",
    "body": "2019/12/14 - Abstract:1The English Law on “medical manslaughter”, manifested through the common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter, may be broadly defined as the defendant’s grossly negligent act  or omission, when acting within the terms of their duty of care, which results in the victim’s death. With the current crisis facing the NHS, prosecution of medical practitioners for medical negligence is growing in prominence as a controversial issue, one of which commentators and medical professionals alike are critical of. In the recent case of R v Bawa-Garba (‘Bawa-Garba’), these criticisms of the current regime concerning gross medical negligence have reached the breaking point. Following a controversial High Court conviction of an NHS junior doctor of gross negligence manslaughter, the Court of Appeal’s refusal the doctor’s leave to appeal sparked a public debate on both legal and political grounds. This case note will begin by providing an account of the Bawa-Garba case. Furthermore, it will consider the problems with the arbitrary standard of gross negligence in the offence of gross negligence manslaughter, and potential incompatibilities with Article 7 of the Human Rights Act (1998). Following that, the legal issues in establishing causation will be examined in light of complications created by existing systemic issues of the NHS, eliciting concern for the “blame culture”2 in the medical profession. Lastly, the argument that the legal uncertainty in this area warrants the re-assessment of the case and the law will be advanced. Part I: Case DigestKey facts3A junior doctor, Dr Bawa-Garba applied for permission to appeal against her jury conviction for gross negligence manslaughter for the death of Jack Adcock, a six-year-old boy with Down’s syndrome. In the Crown Court, the jury found Dr Bawa-Garba guilty by a majority of 10 to 2. She was initially sentenced to 24 months imprisonment and suspended for 24 months. Her application for leave to appeal against the conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in December 2016. Dr Bawa-Garba was the most senior junior doctor on duty at the time when the victim was admitted to the hospital. Jack Adcock was initially treated for acute gastro-enteritis and dehydration and subsequently pneumonia after an x-ray had been taken. The reality was that upon admission to the hospital, the victim’s pneumonia had caused him to go into septic shock, resulting in heart failure. Efforts to resuscitate him were to no avail. The prosecution’s case was that Dr Bawa-Garba’s serious neglect “had contributed to or caused the boy’s death”, includingfailing to recognise the significance of the victim’s blood test results and to detect sepsis; failing to ask her consultant to review the victim’s condition, and failing to notify Jack’s mother not to administer enalapril (one of the victim’s long-term medications) to Jack, which would precipitously drop blood pressure. The Crown contended that Dr Bawa-Garba’s repeated mistakes over a protracted period amounted to conduct and fell so far below the standard of care expected of a competent professional that it amounted to gross negligence, warranting a criminal conviction. 4 IssuesOn appeal, the defendant contended that there had been a misdirection of the jury in determining the question of causation. The trial judge (Nicol J) had directed the jury to consider whether the victim had “died significantly sooner”5 due to the defendant’s negligence for the prosecution to prove their case. The defendant averred that the right test would have been for the jury to “be sure that there would have been significant prolongation of Jack’s life”6 had the right treatment been given. Part II: Case Debate(a) The ambiguities of gross negligenceR v Adomako (‘Adomako’),7 the leading authority on gross negligence manslaughter, defined a five-step test for the offence. Firstly, there must have been a duty of care; secondly, that duty must have been breached; thirdly, the defendant’s breach must have caused the victim’s death; fourthly, there must have been an obvious risk of death, and fifthly, the defendant’s conduct must have been grossly negligent enough to warrant a criminal conviction. The case of Bawa-Garba subjects the third and fifth limbs of the test to scrutiny. To begin with, Bawa-Garba highlights the lack of clarity in the law with regards to the threshold requirement for the establishment of gross negligence. Since merely causing or allowing death to occur through negligence will not incur a charge of manslaughter, criminal liability for the offence requires an extreme deviation from a reasonable standard of care. Academics such as Kazarian, Griffifths and Brazier have identified the main issue with English Law on gross negligence manslaughter as the “elusive concept of grossness”. 8 Such elusiveness can be seen in the differing legal tests that have been developed following Adomako. The threshold for establishing gross negligence was prescribed in Adomako as a “breach of duty (that was) so bad, so obviously wrong, that, having regard to the risk of death involved in it, it can properly be condemned as criminal”. 9 The tone of certitude masks the reality of an ill-defined threshold for gross negligence that fails to adequately distinguish between flagrant negligence and fleeting error. 10 On principle, the Adomako test has often been criticised to be circular,11 with the level of negligence required to hold the defendant culpable being defined as sufficiently negligent to deserve a criminal conviction for manslaughter. 12 Furthermore, the inability of the Adomako test to meet the test of certainty required by Article 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 was challenged in R v Misra (‘Misra’). Article 7 stipulates that one should not be held guilty for an action that was not a criminal offence when it was committed,13 meaning that clarity on the law is required for doctors to know if their actions are grossly negligent and liable to criminalisation. However, this was quashed in Misra by Lord Justice Judge’s assertion that the question was “not whether the defendant’s negligence was gross, and whether, additionally, it was a crime, but whether his behaviour was grossly negligent and consequently criminal”. 14 This clarification, unsatisfactory at best, has been characterised by Horder as a “distinction without difference”,15 exposing just how manifestly undefined the threshold for “gross” conduct remains today. Given that the medical profession is already fraught with unpredictability and precariousness, such added uncertainty evokes great unease with the current state of law. In practice, subsequent case law has departed slightly from this definition. More significantly, differing court interpretations have created a degree of legal uncertainty across different cases, demonstrating the elusive aspect of Kazarian’s observation. While the requirement for negligent conduct to be “gross” was “truly exceptionally bad” in Bawa-Garba, it was defined as “reprehensible conduct” in Misra. The use of judicial epithets for gross negligence reflects what Quick terms the “definitional difficulty” of gross negligence manslaughter in the medical context, with no standardised and objective method of categorising episodes as “gross” or “not gross”. 16 Empirical evidence has shown the lack of a clear distinction to create an ambivalent definition, generating “inconsistencies in the verdicts”. 17 For Dr Bawa-Garba, the repercussions of this meant that her impeccable track record was instantly invalidated by a momentary blunder made after a twelve-hour understaffed shift. Moreover, the fact that there is no statutory footing for gross negligence manslaughter means that the parameters of the crime are defined through case law developments only, despite the severity of the crime. This is further complicated by the fact that Adomako leaves the jury with a wide discretion to decide whether the accused should be convicted. 18 As Lord Mackay’s statement essentially asserts that the jury is deliberating a question of law when deciding whether to convict a defendant. 19 Such discretion produces difficulty in predicting jury decisions by creating a margin to make moral decisions. Despite generating a criminal label upon conviction, gross negligence manslaughter remains an issue in flux. (b) Systemic v Individual failuresHowever, the legal uncertainty created by the ambiguous threshold for establishing grossly negligent conduct is but a preface to the wider debate concerning individual failure in relation to systemic failures within the NHS. The defendant’s innocence found rapport in the medical profession’s strong dissent against the court’s judgement. Many felt the charge for gross negligence manslaughter was unjustified in light of the wider systemic failings of the NHS, contending that Dr Bawa-Garba had been scapegoated for the system’s shortcomings, such as chronic understaffing, a faulty IT system, and poor rotational shift planning. 20 Dr Bawa-Garba’s personal mistakes were to an extent induced by her pressured situation, and, therefore, should not be separated in assessing her overall culpability. Moreover, failure to factor system problems into the trial process has led to a narrowed scope of understanding causation. By failing to couch individual failures in wider systemic issues, the law on causation has fostered a “blame culture”. 21 Such a public reaction can be reasonably construed as reflective of how the law of causation falls short of accounting for the complexities of healthcare. The courtroom dissection of hospital tragedies can and may unfairly attribute the blame to the defendant, failing to consider the unpredictable reality of medical practice particularly within the context of NHS burgeoning problem of overstretched resources. 22 As Anthony Harvey contends, individual acts of negligence are often identifiable as the product of some larger collective process. 23 If it is accepted that criminal responsibility should not start and end with the doctor on trial, then perhaps a widening of the individualistic paradigm currently adopted by the judiciary should follow. (c) Causation and culpabilityTo what extent, if any, should context be factored into the legal issue of establishing causation remains contentious and unclear. In Bawa-Garba, it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove causation by showing that death “occurred significantly sooner”24 when the necessary treatment was not administered, despite it being unclear if the right treatment would have saved the victim’s life. The fact that the victim died significantly sooner due to the defendant’s negligence was held to be an “inescapable corollary”25 of certainty that “competent treatment would have saved or significantly prolonged life”,26 effectively quashing the defendant’s leave to appeal. There has been difficulty in the law in definitively apportioning the extent to which causation is a question of law rather than a question of fact. Theorists such as Brudner27 consider the fairness of imputing the consequence on the defendant, whereas others such as Moore28 would argue that causation should be decided independently of culpability. Such a polarised opinion on whether causation is ultimately a question of fact or law has compromised on the coherence of the law’s approach to causation. Given the complex factual matrix of Bawa-Garba and the nuances typical of the medical environment, it lends credence to Herring’s argument that it is simply impossible for any guiding rules on causation to be established. 29 Rather, the judge simply considers the common-sense answer to the question of causation and declares that to be the legal position. 30 Another key issue with this approach is that it focusses on causal attribution of individual blame, arguably failing to adequately consider the contextual concerns of the case. At the time of the tragedy, Dr Bawa-Garba’s circumstances were clearly fraught with system pressures, including a twelve-hour double-shift during which she was the only junior doctor present, and an IT failure that delayed the victim’s blood test results for six hours. 31 These circumstantial factors, having caused Dr Bawa-Garba’s mistakes, were not sufficiently considered. Given that the offence of gross negligence manslaughter seeks to assess individual culpability, such systemic failings were only considered to be “of peripheral relevance”32 to the trial, and only taken as mitigating factors during the sentencing stage. Donaldson postulates that “avoidable harm is at its most contentious when the focus is on accountability”. 33 By demanding individual accountability, the judicial approach taken to causation seeks to apportion blame to the prosecuted individual in a vulnerable position. The scope for determining causation is narrowed down to the actions of the individual being judged in the courtroom, rather than a holistic consideration of systemic failures. Unfortunately, this seemed to be the case in Bawa-Garba. In response to the case, the Minister of Health ordered an official review of medical manslaughter prosecutions attempting to ensure that “systemic issues and human factors” are taken into account, suggesting that the frame for identifying causation has to be reworked. Concluding thoughtsIn conclusion, this case highlights the incompatibility of criminal justice system with the complex nature of healthcare, illustrating the limits of criminal law in administering justice in the field of medical error. Bawa-Garba evidences that the problem with the law on gross negligence manslaughter lies in its inherent state of unclarity in the areas of causation establishment and the threshold for grossly negligent treatment. Inaccuracies remain both in principle and in practice given the systemic failings of the NHS. As such, this case should have been successfully appealed, and the conviction for manslaughter quashed. The defendant was a victim in her own right, having been ensnared by the ambiguity in the present law on gross negligence manslaughter. Reforms are much needed to rectify the implications of such uncertainty on personal accountability. In determining the issue of gross negligence and causation, failure to consider the realities of practice and systemic failings has created a highly unfair situation, where the weight of one systemic disaster has fallen onto the shoulders of a single doctor as a personal catastrophe.

    "body": "2019/11/29 - R v. Evans: An Uneasy Precedent? In this piece, I discuss the recent case of R v Evans, in which the Court of Appeal allowed the defence to adduce evidence regarding the complainants’ sexual history with third parties in the context of a rape trial. I will assess the academic debate surrounding the controversy the case brought through the expansion of s 41(3)(c) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 to allow such evidence to be adduced. As such expansion has been criticised on the basis that it has created a tension between the complainant’s right to privacy and the defendant’s right to a fair trial, I will outline the criticism of Evans by various academics, addressing whether these criticisms are sound, and put forward my ideas regarding how the problems of Evans can be resolved (i. e. through a cultural change, as opposed to legislative change). This work was initially inspired by LSE’s Law of Evidence class content. I declare that this work has not been submitted elsewhere. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving victims of sexual offences speaking out. It appears therefore timely to review the current law of evidence in this specific context. In particular, the current law concerning sexual history evidence (SHE) has been criticised on the basis that the ruling in R v Evans1 extends the law too far such that it imbalances the trial by working to the detriment of the complainant, particularly her right to privacy. Indeed, there has been a sense that Evans has led to a regression in the law. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was implemented to protect complainants and prevent against the so-called ‘double myth’, however, with Evans as precedent, their protections have been put at risk and the ‘double myth’ has returned. Firstly, this article will outline the law on SHE and will give a brief overview of the Evans case. Then, it will assess whether the law needs reform, drawing on academic debate. Finally, this article will discuss the current proposals for reform and will put forth its own reform idea. In summary, this article strongly argues that the current SHE regime works to the detriment of the complainant in some instances, however, this is due to a misapplication of the law rather than a problem with the law itself. To reform the law and make it more restrictive would work to the detriment of the defendant and his right to a fair trial. Thus, instead of reforming the law, a cultural change is needed regarding the public perception of sexual offences and gender roles. This cultural change would alleviate issues such as deterring victims and victim-blaming. More importantly, this reform option would not compromise either the right of the defendant or the complainant. Understanding the current lawThe admissibility of SHE is governed by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. According to s 41, there is a general ban on the admission of SHE so that the defence is not allowed to ask questions in cross-examination or adduce evidence of the complainant’s sexual behaviour. Sexual behaviour is defined under s 42(1)(c) as meaning previous sexual encounters with the defendant or any other person. In some instances, however, the court may grant leave to the defence to adduce SHE contained in s 41(3)(a), (b) and (c). Per s 41(3)(a), a court may grant leave if SHE is relevant to an issue other than the issue of consent. Other issues include: whether the defendant had a reasonable belief in consent,2 whether the offence was fabricated, or whether there is a false identity issue. Meanwhile, s 41(3)(b) allows the defence to adduce evidence where there is evidence of sexual behaviour ‘at or about the same time’ as the offence. In the case of R v A, ‘at or about the same time’ was defined in dicta as being constrained to twenty-four hours. 3 Finally, s 41(3)(c) provides that evidence of sexual behaviour may be adduced where it is ‘so similar’ to any sexual behaviour the complainant engaged in with the defendant or which took place at the same place/time. This was seen in R v T4 where it was held that the fact that the complainant had engaged in sexual behaviour previously with the defendant at the same place made it more likely she consented. However, these exceptions found within s 41(3) are subject to further restrictions. First, the evidence must relate to ‘specific instances’ of sexual behaviour5; second, a refusal of leave might have the result of rendering an unsafe verdict 6; finally, the purpose must not be to impugn the credibility of the complainant. 7 Case law has further expanded the instances where SHE may be adduced by the defence and this has been evidenced by both R v A and Evans. In R v A, the House of Lords allowed defence counsel to adduce evidence of SHE between the complainant and defendant to provide the jury with context to make a fully informed decision. Indeed, there were concerns that the current regime prevented the jury from knowing the context and potentially prevented the defendant from putting a defence forward. Thus, the court found that the legislation was too restrictive in this respect. The court went as far as to say that preventing the jury from knowing the context could amount to a violation of the defendant’s right to a fair trial per Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, the court introduced an implied provision based on fairness through their s 3 power of the Human Rights Act (HRA). This provision established that if it is necessary to adduce SHE for fairness then it is admissible. 8 Meanwhile, in Evans, the court expanded the s 41(3)(c) provision by allowing SHE regarding conduct between the complainant and third parties to be adduced. The context was that the defendant (Evans) was initially found guilty of rape in 2012. The defendant appealed his conviction; new evidence was brought to light concerning two other men. The two men  claimed they had sex with the complainant around the same time as the alleged rape and described their encounters as similar to Evans’ account. Indeed, the Court of Appeal identified the following ‘similar’ elements: the complainant ‘had been drinking’; she ‘instigated certain sexual activity’; she ‘directed her sexual partner into certain positions’ and ‘used specific words of encouragement. ’9 This was enough to satisfy s 41(3)(c) and so, the defendant was acquitted. However, some commentators have been particularly critical of these developments, arguing that reform is necessary because (a) the current law tilts the balance too heavily in favour of the defendant at the expense of the complainant’s right to privacy10; and (b) it creates a significant risk that the jury takes irrelevant evidence into account. 11 Considering the arguments for reformCertain commentators have viewed Evans and R v A as setting an uneasy precedent which effectively deters victims from reporting sexual offences through the fear of cross-examination of their sex life. Indeed, by establishing that sexual behaviour does not have to be ‘bizarre’ or ‘unusual’12 effectively sets a very low bar on the admission of SHE. However, others have read the ruling in a more sympathetic light. Dent and Paul, for instance, disagree with this claim and argue that it is not the law that deters victims from reporting but the media coverage of sexual offences. 13 In contrast, McGlynn uses empirical data, like surveys and police records, to highlight that the court process, including admission of SHE, does impact on complainants’ decision-making. 14 McGlynn shows that the admissibility of SHE results in many complainants withdrawing their claims for fear of the potential invasion of their privacy and that their sex life may be the subject of the trial, and concludes that there is a need for reform. Indeed, by sacrificing the complainant’s private life, this interpretation of the provision arguably goes against Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, a ‘legal system that allows extensive examination might one day be contrary to Article 8. ’15 Some have also argued that the ruling of Evans evidences a need for reform because the current law encourages victim-blaming. 16 Arguably, with Evans we see a shift in attention from ‘probative credibility’ to ‘moral credibility’. 17 Moral credibility ‘refers to the general ability of a witness to tell the truth. ’18 Moral credibility is problematic since it can ‘distract jurors attention from the consideration of rape, directing them towards that of sex’19 and thus lack of consent versus consent. This ‘Madonna-whore complex’ (in which chastity is moral, and so, trustworthy, whereas unchastity is immoral, and so, untrustworthy) finds that ‘women of ill-repute are not to be trusted in their testimony. ’20 Indeed, Smart observes in a rape trial the complainant’s previous sexual relations are ‘reconstructed into a standard form of sexual fantasy… in which she becomes the slut who turns men on and indicates her availability through every fibre of her clothing and demeanour’21 and so, during the trial, the body ‘becomes literally saturated with sex. ’22 In this respect, SHE ‘risks introducing irrelevant or prejudicial material which may distort rather than promote the fact-finding role of the trial’. 23 Instead, it makes the complainant’s sex life, and behaviours more generally, the subject of the trial. Thus, jurors focus on the ‘respectability’ of women complainants, with evidence of previous sexual activity or any other activity that attracts moral judgement reducing their ‘respectability’ which, in turn, reduces the assessment of credibility. This essentially shifts legal and moral blame from the defendant to the complainant.   When considering this point in the context of Evans, the argument concerning moral credibility is particularly persuasive. Evans has been viewed by some as particularly invasive of the complainant’s private life. Baird, in particular, fears that with Evans as a precedent, rape trials could become inquisitions into the complainant’s sex life,24 and within the adversarial trial, these inquisitions can be quite terrifying seeing as the prime tactic is to discredit complainants. Complainants have, therefore, described the task of appearing in court as ‘worse than the rape itself. ’25 Evans, in this respect, effectively perpetuates the ‘double myth’ that because a woman consented on one occasion, she is more likely to consent on another. Likewise, it perpetuates the ‘double myth’ in the minds of the jury that because of the complainants’ previous sexual activity, she is morally questionable and so, untruthful. Thus, this type of evidence being adduced may, as Redmayne suggests, result in a prejudicial effect whereby the jury might ‘take a dim view of the complainant. ’26 The law on the admissibility of SHE, therefore, needs to be reformed because concerns surrounding the moral credibility of the complainant could result in prejudicial effect against her, which could sway the jury in the defendant’s favour. However, Dent and Paul are critical of the arguments stating that Evans represents a return to the ‘double myth. ’  Instead, they highlight that s 41 is a high bar for SHE to be admitted, and that Evans was a very particular case with a particular set of facts, so it is more the exception than the rule. 27 Yet, this is not the case. As shown by Evans the threshold is not that high. 28 Indeed, in Evans evidence was admitted because in previous sexual encounters, the complainant had been drinking and had used a particular phrase/position. Such commonplace behaviour was considered unusual and this significantly lowers the bar for ‘similarity’. Thus, reform is necessary to overcome issues surrounding moral credibility and prejudicial effect. Finally, commentators such as Redmayne have argued that Evans is problematic in that it assigns probative value to SHE, when such evidence has little probative value. 29 Indeed, just because someone consents to someone on one occasion, that does not make it more or less likely that they will consent to that person (or another person) on another occasion.   There ‘is no probative connection between consenting to one person and consent to a different person. ’30 Criticisms that Evans has brought to light regarding the perpetuation of the so-called ‘double myth’ has led to increased calls for reform. Proposals for reformThere have been some proposals for reform. For instance, the Harman reform proposed a complete abolition on s 41 exceptions, such that that complainants should never be cross-examined regarding their sex life. 31 Commentators such as McGlynn have argued in favour of the Harman reform on the basis that SHE should always be excluded since it is irrelevant. 32 They ask: what is the relevance between consenting to one person on one occasion and consenting to another person on another? Yet this article does not favour such a drastic option. Instead, to view SHE as never relevant is equivalent to viewing the offence of rape from the perspective of the complainant only. This is problematic because the law is already too restrictive. It is, as Birch claims, ‘draconian’ and amounts to ‘legislative overkill’ which goes too far against the rights of the defendant. 33 Hoyano’s study also revealed that many within the law profession viewed the law as already too restrictive. 34 The Canadian court considered an option similar to the Harman reform and concluded that a complete prohibition is inconsistent with the fundamental rights of the defendant to a fair trial. 35 Thus, to reform the law in this way would imbalance the law such that the complainant receives too much protection at the expense of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. This can result in ‘miscarriages of justice’36 because to abolish the s 41 exceptions would mean that the jury has no context upon which to base its decision. This could ultimately lead to unsafe convictions, and perhaps more worryingly, it could lead to false convictions. False convictions should be avoided at all costs since they can have ‘deleterious consequences’ which can result in ‘social, psychological and economic damage. ’37 Instead, this article favours the view that there is no problem with the existing law itself. It has simply been misapplied. Indeed, commentators such as Dent and Paul have attempted to reconcile Evans on the basis that it is a simple application of the law. Dent and Paul claim that due to the similarity between the sexual behaviour of the complainant with the defendant and the complainant with third parties, the case was somewhat analogous to R v T. However, such an argument is unpersuasive because Evans and R v T were not analogous. The case of T concerned SHE between the complainant and the defendant, not the complainant and third parties (like in Evans). Stark’s claims are more persuasive in that the court has ‘misdirected’ its attention to s 41(3)(c) when it should have invoked s 41(2)(b). 38 Thus, the law itself does not need to be reformed, but rather attention should be refocused to s 41(2)(b) as opposed to s 41(3)(c). By focusing on s 41(2)(b) as opposed to s 41(3)(c) would mean the complainant won’t have their private life scrutinised as harshly, and so their right to privacy will be upheld. Rather than a change to the existing law, a better option is a cultural change in people’s attitudes. This change would more easily accommodate the current law without compromising either the right of the defendant to a fair trial or the right of the complainant to privacy. Changing the law is unlikely to have a practical impact especially where those applying these rules of evidence have entrenched views on women and how they behave. When SHE is admitted, even where it is relevant, juries will place considerable weight upon it and effectively creates a ‘smokescreen of immorality around the complainer. ’39 Rape complainants are therefore judged on the basis that women should be adhering to certain moral standards. Failing these standards means there is a high price to pay in that it is unlikely that the jury will trust their testimony. Public and jury education is necessary for this improvement to take place. This would ensure that unfair acquittals based on stereotypes wouldn’t take place. Where there is a cultural change to people’s attitude on rape, issues such as deterrence and victim-blaming will rarely arise. Whilst such an option may not seem attainable, with the growing awareness concerning sexual crimes, especially in light of #MeToo, we are arguably seeing this cultural change take place, albeit slowly. In the meantime, the law should follow Stark’s recommendations that greater attention should be redirected towards s 41(2)(b) rather than the similarity gateway. However, for the law to work effectively in the long term, a change in cultural beliefs about women is necessary such that cases like Evans never occur again. To conclude, Evans is certainly a problematic case in that it has expanded the scope of s 41(3)(c) such that SHE is much easier to adduce due to the low bar (not having to be ‘unusual or ‘bizarre’). Yet to reform the law in the complainant’s favour would make the law too restrictive and would come at the expense of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Although there are certainly persuasive reasons pointing to the need for reform, reform to the law is not necessary. Cultural change combined with a refocusing of the court’s attention to s 41(2)(b) could overcome issues such as victim-blaming and deterrence, without compromising either the defendant’s right to a fair trial or the complainant’s right to privacy.

    "title": "Would becoming a republic be so simple?",
    "body": "2019/10/21 - Would becoming a republic be so simple? Following the Prime Minister’s decision to prorogue Parliament, some Labour MPs have called for the UK to become a republic. This article will outline the possible forms a republic could take and explore the constitutional implications having an elected Head of State would cause. It is argued that the introduction of a President would radically change the UK’s constitutional setup and should be seen with scepticism. Brexit is, once again, testing our uncodified constitution. The Prime Minister’s decision to advise the Queen to prorogue Parliament, which was given effect by an Order in Council, has been challenged in both the High Court and the Court of Session. Critics argue that the decision to suspend Parliament, mere weeks before the UK’s planned exit from the EU on October 31st 2019, is unconstitutional. The Government, in reply, argues that this unduly long parliamentary session should be brought to a close, so that it can bring forward a new legislative programme in the Queen’s Speech. The Supreme Court has since held that the prorogation was unlawful. 1 This article will focus on a different but related matter. Some Labour MPs have argued that, since the Queen is constitutionally bound to follow the advice of her ministers, in this case their advice to prorogue Parliament, the country would be better suited having an elected Head of State. This article will explore some of the constitutional questions that the UK could face if it were to follow these MPs’ suggestion and abolish the monarchy. Moreover, it will be argued that the creation of Presidential role would either radically change the constitutional setup of the UK or be superfluous. The first matter that must be considered if the monarchy is abolished is how its successor would be chosen. One option would be to hold a general election, which is the method of electing the President of Ireland. 2 Alternatively, a special electoral body could be created, with its membership being drawn from Parliament and the devolved legislatures, similar to the German Federal Convention (Bundesversammlung). 3 The method of electing the President is important as it would give some indication as to what type of powers this office would hold and, more importantly, how the holder would be expected to use them. Whilst technically the Queen has considerable power through the prerogatives, the day to day use of these powers is handled by her ministers. A President that is elected  by the people directly through contested elections could be expected to have a greater degree of freedom over the use of those powers than one that was chosen through other methods. Their position would be in stark contrast to a hereditary monarchy. Certainly, no one would be able to claim a directly elected President lacks a democratic mandate. They would be the only national directly elected figure in the country. It should be noted that even the German President does have discretion over the use of their powers, despite the lack of a direct election, although they exercise it with great caution. 4 Given the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended, it is submitted that a direct election would be the preferable model for the UK to follow, as opposed to adopting the German method. This ensures that all parts of the UK have a say in the choice of the President, not merely the countries with a functioning devolved legislature. The Labour MPs who have recently suggested the idea of a republic would seem to want the President not to be beholden to the Prime Minister, presumably in the hope that an elected Head of State would not have given the order to prorogue Parliament. Thus, a President who is able to have at least some discretion over the use of their powers is clearly envisaged. The desirability of the President having this freedom will be discussed below. The leading campaign group in the UK in favour of abolishing the monarchy, Republic, describes on their website their suggestion for how a President would exercise their powers. What is immediately clear is that their solutions go beyond simply removing the monarch and replacing it with an identical elected figure; they are proposing radical changes to the existing constitutional framework. The President would not simply be ceremonial but would have the power to compel politicians to conform to a new codified constitution. 5 Republic envisage the President presiding over the nomination of a new Prime Minister during a hung Parliament as well as speaking out on important issues of the day. 6 By contrast, the Queen does not become involved in choosing the new Prime Minister herself, instead relying on the advice of ministers and is expected to remain silent and neutral on all political issues. They would also be able to use their limited powers according to certain official criteria, presumably laid out in the new constitution. 7  This marks a fundamental break with the current constitutional arrangement. The desirability (or lack of) a codified constitution for the UK need not be considered here, it suffices to say it opens its own Pandora’s Box of constitutional issues. 8 What does concern us now is that under this arrangement, the role of the President goes beyond that which the Queen currently has. No longer would the use of prerogatives rest upon the sole judgment of the Prime Minister. Depending upon how this new constitution is formulated, the President might be able to interfere with decisions we have come to expect to rest with the Prime Minister. Authorising military force or appointing ministers does not require Parliamentary approval, but the President could for example refuse to authorise military action unless the Commons voted in favour. Theresa May explicitly refused to seek a Commons vote over airstrikes in Syria but was able to authorise military action through the prerogative powers. 9 This would mark a dramatic shift of power from the Prime Minister to the President. It would create a division of executive power that currently does not exist. The potential for conflict between the President and Prime Minister is obvious, especially if they belong to different political parties. It cannot be assumed that the party who is able to form a majority in the Commons would also win a Presidential election. Under the first past the post electoral system, a political party does not need to win a majority,10 or even a plurality of votes to form a Government. 11 If, as regional mayors are elected, a runoff system with transferable votes is used to elect a President, which requires a majority of votes to be elected, it is possible that the President and Prime Minister could belong to different political parties. Even if the President was chosen by representatives from the devolved legislatures and Parliament, given that the largest political party in each body is different, it cannot be assumed the President would always belong to the same party as the Government. 12 A key advantage of the UK’s current constitutional setup is its efficiency. The Government enjoys the support of the Commons and is able to pass legislation with relative ease to enact the policies it was elected on and can use the prerogative powers as it sees fit. Introducing a new powerful position could impede that process. It is submitted that such a change should be treated with great caution. It would create a powerful new constitutional figure who could, and likely would, challenge the Prime Minister’s authority. Supporters of a powerful Presidential role may argue that the Prime Minister lacks sufficient scrutiny. Since they command a Commons majority, they (usually) have little difficulty winning votes. Thus, the separation of executive powers might be welcomed. However, this overlooks some features of the current constitutional arrangement. Firstly, Prime Ministers do face defeats in the Commons. The legislature is not entirely beholden to the executive and through defeating the Government in votes in the Commons acts as a check on their power. David Cameron was forced to abandon plans for airstrikes in Syria after failing to win a Commons vote on the matter. Whilst he still had the power to authorise military action, the political realities of the defeat prevented him from doing so. 13 More fundamentally, it has become an understanding of the UK constitution that for as long as the Government can command a majority, it can exercise the prerogatives at its discretion. The Commons always retains the power to bring down a government that abuses these powers. Section 2 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 lays out the procedure for passing a no confidence motion, which, if successful, can lead to a general election. Whilst the party whipping system means that the likelihood of a MP voting against their own party in government is low, as the current Brexit crisis has shown, MPs have expressed their willingness to do so if they feel the Government is abusing their powers, even if this means losing their party whip. 14 In the argument for a powerful President, one should not ignore the fact that the Commons already retains the power to act as a check on the Government. There are at least three alternative arrangements to a President who is able to use their powers in the way described above. Firstly, one could simply elect a President but with the clear understanding, either in statute or by constitutional convention, that they will simply follow the Prime Minister’s advice when exercising the prerogative powers. In essence, it would be the same system as now, but with an elected Head of State rather than a hereditary one. This would prevent the friction between the Prime Minister and the President. However, one needs to question the point of this. Their role would be simply ceremonial. There is a political question as to whether there is a point in electing someone to do the role the Queen currently does. Moreover, it would not appease the Labour MPs who have recently suggested a republic, as it would mean the President would exercise the perogatives in the same way the Queen currently does, in obedience with the Prime Minister’s instructions. There is middle path of the powers of the Presidency that they could only intervene in cases where fundamental values and rights are at stake. Thus, there would not be the interference by the President in day to day affairs of Government. This is based on the notion that the Presidency would have some democratic mandate. This model should be rejected. The scope of what would fall into this rights category is intolerably unclear. Does this only include the rights protected in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), or other issues such as socio-economic rights? If the former, the Human Rights Act 1998 already gives the courts ample powers to protect such rights,15 thus rendering the President’s power superfluous. Moreover, it is constitutional more appropriate for the courts to decide these matters since they are a better arbiter of what constitutes a breach of the ECHR than a President. If the President were allowed to intervene on a broader understanding of rights, the scope for intervention is indeterminable. A President may conclude that healthcare or education reforms fall under this remit. Ultimately, the courts would likely have to intervene to set the limits of Presidential power. The third option would be to combine the roles of Head of State and Government. The Prime Minister could embody both. Since the use of prerogative powers already de facto rests with the Prime Minister, this would not be such a radical change. The only question that would need to be resolved is how the Prime Minister is appointed. Formally, the Sovereign appoints the person who can command the support of the Commons as Prime Minister. There would need to be a mechanism for appointing a new Prime Minister after a general election, resignation, or a vote of no confidence. Two options present themselves. Either the outgoing Prime Minister could appoint the person who would succeed them i. e. the leader of the party who has just won the election, or their own successor in their party. However, this might be politically unfashionable as it would mean leaders of opposite parties would have to appoint their rivals as Prime Minister e. g. an outgoing Conservative leader would have to appoint a Labour leader as Prime Minister. This issue is particularly troubling during hung Parliaments, such as the present, with a high chance of a successful no confidence motion. Section 2(3)(b) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 allows for two weeks after a successful motion of no confidence for a confidence motion to pass, either restoring the existing government or installing a new one A Prime Minister who has just lost this vote might be tempted to refuse to appoint a successor, instead pressing for an election. Such a move has been suggested by Boris Johnson. There is an alternative mechanism which could avoid this problem. At the start of a new Parliament after an election, or during the two weeks after a successful no confidence vote, Parliament could pass a motion proclaiming the new Prime Minister with that person immediately being installed. It would be Parliament who exercises the power to appoint the Prime Minister, rather than the Head of State. For example, if Boris Johnson were to be defeated in a vote of no confidence and the Commons passed a confidence motion in another leader, such as Jeremy Corbyn, the latter would immediately become the Prime Minister. This method would remove the responsibility of the outgoing Prime Minister to name their successor. Moreover, this would give a clear indication that they can command the confidence of the House of Commons and in the majority of cases, it would be a mere formality. Usually one party will command a majority in the Commons, either by themselves or with an arrangement with smaller parties, and they would be able to pass a motion naming their party leader as Prime Minister. A statute would need to be passed to transfer the power of appointing the Prime Minister from the executive to Parliament. As the House of Lords decided in AG v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel, if a statute replaces the prerogative then the prerogative is put in abeyance and the statutory scheme has to be used. 16 Neither of these solutions would not be a radical departure from the current system, as the Queen does not choose herself who to appoint, but rather faces the realities of the Parliamentary mathematics. However, this arrangement would not satisfy the Labour MPs. Control of the prerogatives would still have been under the Prime Minister’s control. In light of the Supreme Court’s decision, finding against the Government on the lawfulness of the prorogation, the need for an elected Head of State is somewhat weakened. The courts have shown that they are willing and able to hold the executive to account over the use of prerogative powers. Whilst the political use of the powers still lies with the Prime Minister, which under a Presidential system they may not, the courts will ensure they are used legally. The question remains whether a second political actor to act as a check on the Prime Minister is desirable. Ultimately, the debate over whether the UK should transform into a republic is a political question. What this article has sought to sketch is some of the legal difficulties and questions the UK would face if it were ever to abolish the monarchy. It is doubtful whether it would be simple for the current constitutional arrangement to be translated into a republican format. The  creation of a Presidential role, that would have been able to refuse Johnson’s wish to prorogue Parliament, could have unintended consequences further down the line. If, as is more likely, the Sovereign was replaced with a President, it is doubtful they would maintain the same subservient role the monarchy plays to the Prime Minister. Their democratic legitimacy would likely mean they would engage in day to day politics, particularly in divisive issues such as Brexit. Such a marked change to the current constitution presents a real danger of creating constitutional crisis over conflicts between the President and Prime Minister that could not arise under the current system.

    "title": "Private law protection of human rights from corporate abuses: deep and meaningful?",
    "body": "2019/10/17 - Commentary on Lungowe and others v Vedanta Resources plc and Kokola Copper Mines plc [2019] UKSC 201 The need to secure individual human rights from corporate malpractice is of increasing importance in recent years in light of industrial incidents causing considerable injury to individuals and damage to properties and the environment. 2 The UK Supreme Court’s recent decision in Lungowe v Vedanta Resources plc and Kokola Copper Mines plc,3 commented as “the most important judicial decision in the field of business and human rights since the jurisdictional ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum in 2013,”4 is the latest entry on the English jurisprudence on the protection of human rights against corporate abuses and malpractices. Although formally a jurisdictional ruling, it has provided important insights on how English courts will assess whether a defendant corporation(s) has breached its duty of care to the relevant claimants. A duty of care owed by a private company, despite being a private law matter, has considerable implications for the necessary human rights protection that the law should offer in favour of stakeholders affected by corporate malpractices. An example of this would be a fundamental human right to health. 5 This article will focus on two issues: (i) the Supreme Court’s (“the Court”) approach to determining the existence of a duty of care owed by a corporation to others and breaches of such duty, and (ii) the approach to determining the proper forum for suing an anchor defendant. 6 It argues that the Court’s approach to finding the existence of a duty of care is commendable but potentially analytically confusing. Similarly, concerning the Court’s approach to the determination of the proper forum in the present context, it argues that the Court’s approach improves the ability of the assessment to be tailored closer to the facts, but the cost of less predictable application of the law. Facts and appellate historyFrom Chingola in Zambia, 1,826 people claimed that Vedanta Resources plc (“Vedanta plc”) (an English holding company with a small office in London but controlled a huge amount of assets) breached its duty of care to ensure that its Zambian subsidiary (Konkola Copper Mines plc (“KCM plc”); biggest private employer in Zambia but had few assets of its own) would not harm the environment surrounding its mining sites and local communities. The claimants claimed compensation for personal injury, property damage, loss of income, amenity and enjoyment of land because of discharges from copper mines. In response, Vedanta plc and KCM plc argued that the English courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim and the proceedings should be stayed on forum non conveniens grounds. At the first instance,7 Coulson J granted jurisdiction over the claims and held that the case could not be fairly pursued in Zambia. At the Court of Appeal,8 Simon LJ (with whom Jackson LJ and Asplin LJ agreed with) confirmed that the foreign citizens may pursue legal claims in England against English-based multinational companies for their overseas activities. On the claims, Simon LJ summarised the following principles at [83] about the determination of the existence of a duty of care owed by a parent company of a multinational corporation:- ● The starting point is the three-part test of foreseeability, proximity, and reasonableness from the seminal tort case of Caparo Industries plc v Dickman. 9 ● A duty of care may be owed by a parent company to an employee of a subsidiary, or a party directly affected by the operations of that subsidiary. Such duty of care may arise where the company (a) has taken direct responsibility for devising a material health and safety policy the adequacy of which is the subject of the claim, or (b) controls the operations which give rise to the claim. Simon LJ also held that England and Wales was the proper place to bring trial, and defended Coulson J’s decision as he was “entitled to view that it was inappropriate for the litigation to be conducted in parallel proceedings involving identical or virtually identical facts, witnesses and documents, in circumstances where the claim against Vedanta would in any event continue in England. ”10 Considerable emphasis was laid on a need to avoid similar proceedings in two jurisdictions. He further noted that if the claimants litigated against KCM plc in Zambia, they would not obtain justice for a number of reasons: (i) they would not be able to afford the cost of any legal representation even with their low levels of earnings in the first place,11 (ii) Condition Fee Agreements are unlawful in Zambia and thus the claimants could not avail of it,12 (iii) there was no prospect for the claimants to obtain legal aid,13 (iv) prospect of ad hoc funding was unrealistic,14 (v) no private lawyers with relevant experience were willing and capable of taking on such claims in Zambia,15 (vi) previous environmental litigations in Zambia had failed for various reasons,16 and (vii) KCM plc was likely to adopt an obdurate approach to litigation in Zambia thus resulting in an enormous increase of time and cost. 17 The appeal to the Supreme Court raised three questions on jurisdiction, two of which are relevant to the discussion on the Court’s approach to jurisdiction and forum non conveniens: (i) whether England and Wales was the proper place to bring the claims, and (ii) even if Zambia would otherwise be the proper place, whether there was a real risk that the claimants would not obtain access to substantial justice in Zambia. Lord Briggs’s contextualised approachesParent company's duty of careHolding that ownership of a subsidiary company by a parent company does not impose a duty to take control of the management of the operations or business owned by the subsidiary, Lord Briggs noted that “everything depends on the extent to which, and the way in which, the parent availed himself of the opportunity to take over, intervene in, control, supervise or advise the management of the relevant operations … of the subsidiary. ”18 The intervention of the English-domiciled parent companies in the management of subsidiaries’ operations and their human rights and environmental performance may give rise to a duty of care to third parties, for example local communities. The human rights of such third parties is thus indirectly protected by prudent, or at least well-planned, corporate practices. Instead of focusing only on the subsidiary company itself, both the parent and subsidiary companies will be required to contribute to prudent corporate practices and mitigate the detrimental impacts of corporate practices on e. g. local communities. The duty is, moreover, not merely limited to health and safety issues. Moving on, Lord Briggs also refused to compartmentalise and categorise the cases and scenarios under which a parent company would be liable. In light of the lack of any limitations to models of management, Lord Briggs was “reluctant to seek to shoehorn all cases of the parent’s liability into specific categories of that kind, helpful though they will no doubt be for the purposes of analysis. ”19 Lord Briggs argued that the existence of group-wide policies and guidelines per se and the parent’s expectation on the subsidiary to comply with them is not sufficient for finding a duty of care. It is necessary for the parent company, instead of merely proclaiming such policies, to “take active steps, by training, supervision and enforcement, to see that they are implemented by relevant subsidiaries. ”20 Alternatively, a parent company may incur a duty of care to a third party if, in its published materials, “[the company] holds itself out as exercising that degree of supervision and control of its subsidiaries, even if it does not in fact do so. ”21 In such circumstances, the parent company’s omission from acting may constitute an abdication of the responsibility which it has publicly undertaken. The published materials of Vedanta plc was held to show that the company had “asserted its own assumption of responsibility for the maintenance of proper standards of environmental control over the activities of the subsidiaries, and in particular the operations of the Mine … to show that it is well arguable that a sufficient level of intervention by Vedanta in the conduct of operations at the Mine may be demonstrable at trial…“22 *Forum non conveniens* and proper place for trialFor the Respondents to persuade the Court to decline jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens, two requirements must be satisfied:23 (i) they need to show that the foreign forum is “clearly more appropriate,” and (ii) “substantial justice” will be done at the foreign form – stay of proceedings will not be granted in favour of the defendant if “substantial justice” will not be done at the foreign forum. Firstly, under (i), in contrast to Coulson J’s and Simon LJ’s analysis based on the need to avoid parallel proceedings and judgements, Lord Briggs argued that the purpose of avoiding irreconcilable judgements should be balanced against other connecting factors which link the case with the foreign forum. As Vedanta plc had consented to submit to the jurisdiction of Zambian courts, the choice of the forum of litigation now enjoyed by the claimants renders the possibility of irreconcilable judgements no longer a decisive or conclusive answer to the question of the appropriateness of forum. 24 This is because it becomes possible for both parties to agree to litigate in Zambian courts. Coulson J’s determination on this point is thus an error of principle. 25 Lord Briggs then moved on to note that, while the risk of irreconcilable judgements was a relevant factor and contoured against holding Zambia as the proper forum, the other connecting factors in the present case showed that Zambia was “the overwhelmingly the proper place for the claim to be tried. ”26 In such an assessment, “it is sensible to stand back and look at the matter in the round. ”27 Moving on to the second limb of the forum non conveniens test, for the court to exercise discretion and permit English proceedings, it is necessary to satisfy the court “…by cogent evidence … there is a real risk that substantial justice will not be obtainable in that foreign jurisdiction. ”28 Lord Briggs found in favour of the claimant that substantial justice will not be done if the claim was pursued in Zambia, the key issue being the lack of funding. While there existed various forms of funding, it was found that “most were unavailable but that the one which was in principle available would not attract a legal team which was both prepared to act, and able to do so with the requisite resources and experience. ”29 The need for expert evidence and work in the present case, from the legal team representing the claimants, be “paid for as disbursements, but it will still need to be supervised by competent and experienced lawyers. ”30 The “unavoidable scale and complexity of this case (wherever litigated)”31 has led the judge to conclude, correctly in Lord Briggs’s opinion, that in light of the limited funding and legal resources available within Zambia, substantial justice could not be achieved in Zambian courts. Implications of Lungowe and future developmentsParent company liabilitiesTo begin with, Lord Briggs’s judgement of the existence of a duty of care owed by parent companies is an important step towards enhancing corporate accountability for human rights violations. The contextualised approach at [49] focusing on the extent of intervention by the parent company into the subsidiary’s operations allow for a more accurate assessment of the actual scope of liability that should be borne by the parent. This is because the “human rights” under consideration in the present case are likely to be, in contrast to the fundamental rights found in the e. g. the European Convention on Human Rights,32 of a socio-economic character. An example mentioned at the start of this article is a right to health under Article 12 of the International Convention on Economics, Social and Cultural Rights. This would be particularly important for countries like Zambia, a third-world country in a developing status and the nation’s social-economic infrastructure and rights protection are not as robust as first-world countries. Instead of imposing any direct judicial standards on the requisite standard of duty of care to be satisfied, Lord Briggs’s judgement has struck a delicate balance between the need to maintain (i) the need for autonomy and flexibility in corporate practices and (ii) the need for judicial oversight in monitoring multinational companies and their practices, in particular the subsidiaries, in less-developed countries across the globe. Another point to note is the open-ended nature of the scope of liability borne by parent companies. It should be seen as an improvement from the seminal Court of Appeal case of Chandler v Cape plc in 2012. 33 In Chandler, Arden LJ laid down four requirements to be satisfied in order for the court to impose on a parent company responsibility for the health and safety of its subsidiary’s employees. 34 Arden LJ’s approach was more restrictive than Lord Briggs’s formulation for two reasons. Firstly, the Chandler duty of care only focused on the health and safety policies of the subsidiary company, instead of the general management of the “relevant operations” of the subsidiary. Lord Briggs’s formulation allows for a more expansive range of policies and practices to be covered in assessing whether the parent company should be adjudged to owe a duty of care to the relevant parties. The court enjoys a “broad supervisory spectrum”35 in monitoring the policies and practices of the multinational corporation, based on the instructions of the parent company, as a whole. Secondly, and more importantly, Lord Briggs’s approach is not limited to the employees of the subsidiary company, but may include third parties affected by the corporation’s operation, for example local communities. This expands the scope of accountability of the parent company, thus encouraging them to be more mindful of the possible consequences and implications of their practices on potential stakeholders related or relevant to its business operations. As a matter of legal analysis, Lord Briggs’s judgement can be seen as a scale for determining whether a parent company should be held to have owed a duty of care to the relevant stakeholders, and thus whether it has breached its duty of care (as adjudged to have existed). This scale is based on the extent of participation and intervention into the subsidiary’s operations. This, however, gives rise to the possible scenario and incentive of a hands-off parent company permitting its subsidiary to commit human rights abuses for business purposes,36 yet to be adjudged to have not intervened sufficiently into the subsidiary’s operations and thus cannot be said to have owed any duty of care. Robert McCorquodale observes that this would undermine developments in human rights due diligence on the part of multinational corporations. 37 Omission on the part of the parent company may, therefore, not be seen as a breach of duty of care (since there could not be any duty of care in the first place). This is particularly problematic for vulnerable third parties, for example local communities, that do not have adequate resources to protect their neighbourhood and natural resources from being damaged by the business operations of subsidiaries of multinational corporations. A possible remedy for this loophole may be found in the requirements offered by Arden LJ in Chandler. It is worthy to note that Arden LJ formulated the parent company’s involvement in the subsidiary’s business operations as “has or ought to have. ”38 The “ought” part of the formulation is illuminating, as it allows the court to escape the analytical loophole mentioned in the foregoing paragraph and hold that the parent should have intervened in the first place. Instead of focusing on what the parent company has done or offered to do, the incorporation of Arden LJ’s analysis in Lord Briggs’s formulation could allow a court to find what the parent company should have done. This would also fit in nicely with Lord Briggs’s refusal to compartmentalise cases of parent’s liability at [50], as a type of case in which the parent should have asserted responsibility but nevertheless failed to. Alternatively, considerations over what the parent company should have done may be seen as an example of being “reasonable” to hold the company to have owed a duty of care under the Caparo test. Under Lords Brigg’s emphasis on the general management and operations of the subsidiary company, this may suggest that liability for omissions may encompass the parent company’s inaction in terms of ensuring that the subsidiary’s relevant management and operations would not be contrary to the human rights interests of stakeholders, in particular local communities and vulnerable individuals. Forum non conveniens and proper place for trialThe continued application of the two-part test of forum non conveniens protects the legal and analytical certainty needed for such analysis. Such certainty is particularly crucial in the present context as it carries considerable implications on the proper role of a domestic court in deciding whether to intervene into a case which may be more appropriately held in a foreign court. The most important change brought by Lord Briggs’s judgement, it is submitted, is the diminished importance of the policy of avoiding parallel proceedings as a factor in determining the appropriate place for a trial involving an anchor defendant. On this point, Ekaterina Aristova argues that the policy of avoiding parallel proceedings had more force in the jurisdictional analysis of the judgement than the existence of any territorial connections between England and claims against the foreign subsidiary. 39 What was not resolved in Lord Briggs’s judgement is, however, the actual importance and position of the factor of (risk of) irreconcilable judgements in the first limb of the forum non conveniens test (the “clearly more appropriate” component). This is because, despite connecting factors now being given primary (or at least increased) importance in the first limb of the test, it is unclear the extent to which the need to avoid parallel proceedings should be given weight. Given such an important change in the method of determining proper forum, Lord Briggs could have clarified the analytical flow in determining whether an English court is the proper forum for hearing cases like Lungowe. The identification of proper forum also raises concerns about the future of litigating negligence claims against English-domiciled parent companies in English courts. Following Lungowe, English courts will not treat jurisdictional rules as decisive of the question of proper forum, but will focus more on the balance of connecting factors to determine where the proper forum for litigating claims against the foreign subsidiary is. This takes place in the final step of the forum non conveniens test - only after having determined that the impugned foreign court is the appropriate forum for the trial. The outcome of the forum non conveniens inquiry will now be dependent on the achievement of substantial justice in the foreign court. 40 It must not be ignored, however, that “substantial justice” was not given a comprehensive elaboration in terms of the possible scope of considerations that can arise under it. Putting such criticism to its strongest, “substantial justice” may be interpreted as a wild card for the court to grant English proceedings in order to allow claimants to avail themselves of the comprehensive English tort rules in pursuing claims against multinational corporations. That being said, it is submitted that Lord Briggs’s analysis is unlikely to be interpreted as such. This is because his analysis is, appropriately, focused on the need to ensure access to justice for the disadvantaged claimants. Given access to justice (in particular, right of access to courts) has always been one of the rights most cherished by English courts in common law,41 Lord Briggs’s focus on access to justice is a prudent formulation of what “substantial justice” should entail. The key should always be on the possibility of access to justice and allowing claimants to have their claims properly heard and assessed. ConclusionThe need to protect the human rights of stakeholders in the context of the business operations of multinational corporations presents a delicate challenge for the courts. Tasked with balancing the need for robust human rights protection and restraint from excessive judicial intervention in corporate practices and possible hearings in foreign forums, Lungowe has struck a commendable balance between the two. It has also presented a breath of fresh air on important questions of corporate accountability in private law, which has considerable implications on human rights protection indirectly offered by the court. Although a full assessment of Lord Briggs’s judgement cannot be conducted in the limited space of this commentary, it is clear that it represents an important step in enhancing human rights protection for stakeholders in business operations of multinational corporations across an increasingly globalised business environment.

    "body": "2019/10/09 - In general, the privilege against self-incrimination (“PSI”) protects a defendant from being compelled to provide (potentially) incriminating statement or information. PSI may be asserted by a defendant in a civil proceeding in opposition to a disclosure order. Like the double-edged sword of Themis, PSI cuts both ways. Upholding a defendant’s assertion of PSI may damage the interest of a claimant. Abrogating PSI may benefit the claimant at the cost of a defendant’s right to trial.  This article argues that the respective approaches of courts in Australia and England &amp; Wales are both unsatisfactory. The main aim of this article is to persuade readers that this area of common law must be replaced by a statutory abrogation of PSI and corresponding prohibition against the use of information obtained in such disclosure order against the defendant in a subsequent criminal prosecution.   The PSIThe exact origin of this common law right in the United Kingdom is outside of my repertoire. Briefly, it may date back to the abolition of the Court of Star Chamber, which was notorious for extracting admissions of guilt using torture. 1 It more likely evolved from the common law’s repackaging of the Canon law doctrine of nemo tenetur seipsum accusare (no one is bound to incriminate themselves). 2 The United States of America enshrined this common law right under the 5^th^ Amendment of its constitution. Justice Goldberg in the Murphy v Waterfront Commission3 case provides a powerful rationale for the PSI rule based on the principles of liberty and fair trial: “The privilege against self-incrimination ‘registers an important advance in the development of our liberty – one of the great landmarks in man’s struggle to make himself civilized…It reflects many of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: our unwillingness to subject those suspected of crime to the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt…“4 A defendant in a civil trial is also entitled to the protection of PSI. Indeed, it would be quite inconsistent if the law protects defendants in criminal proceedings but not in civil proceedings, for what is said in a civil court (under oath/ affirmation) may be equally prejudicial and incriminating. For instance, it is not uncommon for courts to grant an ancillary disclosure order in aid of a Mareva5 injunction. 6 The rationale is simple: the effectiveness of the asset-freezing order would be in serious doubt if the claimant has no idea where the defendant’s assets are located, such that it is very hard to monitor whether the order is complied with. The defendant is bound to disclose the information identified in the order against the threat of contempt. Here, if PSI does not apply in civil trial, the defendant is forced to either incriminate himself or perjure. The effect would be that PSI is infringed categorically in civil proceedings: an unthinkable result. Criticism of PSI in Civil TrialsDespite the real threat to a defendant’s right to fair trial, PSI in civil trials is subjected to formidable judicial criticism. As noted by Lord Neuberger MR in Gray, Lord Templeman once described PSI as “an archaic and unjustifiable survival from the past” and questioned whether PSI should be retained in civil proceedings at all. 7 The reason given for such a strongly worded criticism is that PSI in civil trials does nothing to protect a defendant from being ill-treated by police or prevent confession wrongly extracted from being admitted in a criminal court, as structural reforms of the way police treats and interviews suspects are needed to ensure fair treatment of criminal defendants. 8 For instance, the prosecution may adduce evidence of confessions improperly obtained. If admitted, such confession would not be subjected to protection by PSI. However, Lord Templeman’s objection cannot be put too highly. Protecting a defendant from ill treatment of police is one of the many concerns of a criminal justice system. A defendant may be compelled by the courts on application by the claimant to disclose incriminating/ potentially incriminating information about themselves. This has nothing to do with the police treatment of suspects. The author nonetheless agrees with Lord Templeman to the extent that PSI in civil trials should be treated with suspicion. Besides the reasons given by Lord Templeman, it is submitted that there are at least two other reasons for not categorically upholding PSI in civil proceedings. Firstly, there is a fundamental difference between the subject matter of a civil and criminal trial. The prosecution, if successful, will result in criminal penalties and related social/ political costs to the defendant. For instance, the defendant may be imprisoned and/ or have their future job prospect and social standing affected. In contrast, the claimant is attempting to obtain civil remedies, largely in the form of monetary awards. Thus, a civil defendant who is forced by court to make disclosures is facing less serious consequences in comparison to a criminal defendant who is forced to answer incriminating questions. Of course, the first reason does not lose sight of the possibility that what’s said or disclosed in a civil case could be used in a criminal case (as noted above). Thus, the second reason looks at the role of alternative protection in criminal and civil trials. In a criminal trial, it makes no sense to talk about alternative protection given in substitution to PSI. The purpose of a criminal trial is to determine whether the defendant committed the crime(s) charged. What is said or adduced in evidence goes to that purpose. It would make a laughing stock out of courts to force the defendant to make incriminating statements while telling the jury (or the judge reminding her/himself) to disregard such statement. However, in a civil trial, alternative protection could potentially work to achieve a balance between protecting the defendant and upholding the interest of the claimant (discussed in more detail below).   However, the author disagrees with Lord Templeman in that PSI should not be banished altogether from civil courts. Indeed, even Lord Neuberger MR qualified his criticism of the PSI by saying that it can be abolished if adequate alternative protection along the lines of section 72(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (discussed below) could be offered. 9 Lord Neuberger MR’s cautious approach is laudable for three reasons. Firstly, the risk of prejudice to the claimant is comparatively less serious than that to the defendant. A claimant may receive a less effective form of civil remedy on the one hand. On the other hand, the risk to a defendant’s liberty and right to fair trial is arguably graver. Secondly, in interlocutory proceedings, once disclosure is made, information cannot be ‘un-disclosed’ if it turns out to be wrongly granted after substantive hearing. The damage to the defendant’s right to fair trial is permanent. Thirdly, the grant of interlocutory injunction is not subjected to a high bar (see the American Cyanamid10 principle). This means that defendants may be compelled to incriminate themselves without the claimant fully proving its case. If the right to assert PSI in civil proceedings should be subjected to limitations to strike a balance between protecting the defendant and ensuring a claimant gets the just remedies, two further issues arise: (1) What is sufficient alternative protection? And (2) Is statutory reform the way forward? Abrogating PSI and the adequacy of protection questionThe English &amp; Welsh line of authorities suggest that courts may abrogate PSI if it is satisfied that adequate protection could be substituted. However, this has not always been the case. In Bishopgate Investmnet Management Ltd, Dillon LJ stated very strongly that “any decision” to limit or curtail PSI is “essentially a political decision…[which is] a matter for Parliament”11. However, subsequent cases instead ask whether sufficient alternative protection could be given to a defendant. See for instance in AT&amp;T Istel Ltd, the court was satisfied the defendant could be adequately protected, hence a disclosure order was made. In that case, the CPS submitted a letter acknowledge that it would not be using any information disclosed pursuant to a disclosure order. The judge thus saw fit to issue an order forbidding the use of disclosed information in any subsequent criminal prosecution. While this raises an interesting constitutional question as to the limits of judicial power to modify long standing common law right, it is better dealt with in more depth and focus in a separate piece. The current English &amp; Welsh approach begs the question however, what is sufficient protection. One may think it could take the form of a claimant’s undertaking to the court that it or any of its associates shall not disclose the information to the police or prosecuting authority. It may seem that such an undertaking is sufficient. Afterall, if a claimant discloses such information, (s)he may be liable for contempt. However, such undertaking misses the point of PSI. The aim of PSI is to protect a defendant against the risk of prosecution and to prevent compelled statements to be relied on in a criminal trial. The undertaking merely prevents a claimant from adducing the disclosed information to the law enforcement authorities, it does not prevent any such evidence to be relied on in a court by a prosecutor. While the question arise as to the possibility that the prosecution could obtain such evidence, the existence of a possibility cannot be ignored and that the mere fact of disclosure may “set in train a process which may lead to incrimination or may lead to the discovery of real evidence of an incriminating character. ”12 Indeed, a line of English authority suggest quite correctly that on top of an undertaking by the claimant, there must also be an undertaking from the prosecution. In Rank Film, Lord Wilberforce stated in the context of an Anton Piller13 order that the protection offered by an undertaking from the plaintiff is only partial, since it does not bind the prosecution. 14 Thus,  the Court of Appeal in United Norwest Co-Operatives Ltd15 allowed an appeal against a disclosure order on the ground that the defendant’s right to assert PSI was infringed, as the Crown Prosecution Service (“CPS”) was not notified of the proceeding and no undertaking was offered. The reason why a CPS undertaking is required is that the CPS cannot be bound by a court order against its will in making its prosecutorial decisions. However, the CPS may, as it did in AT&amp;T Istel LTd, undertake not to use material disclosed pursuant to a disclosure order against the defendant in a criminal proceeding. 16 However, without such undertaking, the court would not be able to provide an adequate substituted protection. 17 The Australian approach affords comparatively stronger protection to the defendant. In Reid v Howard18, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales followed the House of Lords’ decision in AT&amp;T Istel Ltd19 by Handley JA. However, the Court of Appeal decision was reversed by the High Court of Australia. In the majority judgment, the PSI “is not simply a rule of evidence, but a basic and substantive common law right” and can only be overridden by legislation. 20 The High Court’s decision in Reid v Howard case is followed in subsequent cases. In Vasil, Fitzgerald JA unequivocally stated that an order of disclosure will be set aside if it infringes PSI without statutory warrant. 21 Clearly then, the Australian authorities are in direct conflict with the English position. It will be argued below that both the Australian approach and English approach are problematic. PragmatismIt is submitted that the Australian courts’ refusal to abrogate or limit PSI even where adequate substitute protection is available is problematic. There is a paradox here: if the source of PSI is common law, the courts should be able to qualify or even abolish it. Unfortunately, the justices in Reid did not discuss this problem. The rationale seems to be that PSI is “deeply ingrained in the common law” and “lies at the heart of the administration of the criminal law”. 22 It is not very clear whether the justices were hinting that the PSI has developed beyond a common law principle, such that it is part and parcel of the whole justice system above the reach of courts. Nevertheless, the Australian position here is questionable at the minimum. It takes an extremely cautious approach: whenever a defendant shows PSI is engaged, a disclosure order would be refused. Is this level of caution necessary to protect the interests of a defendant? If it can be shown that the prosecution will be precluded from relying on information disclosed pursuant to a civil court order, then there should not be a risk to a defendant’s right to fair (criminal) trial. In fact, PSI is not ignored. The only reason why a court would go a step further in precluding the use of disclosed information in a subsequent criminal case is because it had the defendant’s PSI in mind. In such a case, the rationale for upholding PSI seems to drift away, so does the legal reasons for depriving the claimant of its rightful remedies. It can therefore be said that the High Court of Australia failed to pragmatically consider the practical impact of a disclosure order on the defendant’s PSI. PracticalityThe E&amp;W approach involves an undertaking from the CPS, which immediately attracts objections based on practicality. The central criticism here is twofold: the first is legal certainty. It is hard to see what incentive the CPS has in giving such undertaking. In fact, there are plenty of disincentives for giving such undertaking, as it may irreparably damage an ongoing investigation or prosecution, on top of increasing their administrative workload. Further, as noted by Professor Neil Andrews, justice is not always done in every case, since it remains the prosecutor’s discretion to order disclosure even if all the legal requirements are satisfied. It is hardly acceptable that whether or not a claimant gets relief depends on the discretion of the prosecutors. 23 The author agrees with Professor Andrews, consistency is the benefit to both parties here. The defendant should have its basic right protected consistently and not live the fear that the CPS may exercise the discretion against them. Relief for the claimant should also be certain where the legal test for it is satisfied. The second, more jurisprudential objection, is that the CPS should not be the ultimate arbiter of whether a claimant receives legal redress. The CPS’ decision to give an undertaking will likely be based on how ‘badly’ they want the defendant. This is a consideration alien to the civil dispute between the defendant and claimant. It is outside of the control, and often unknown to both parties. One may say this is like the judge’s consideration of public or legal policy. It is not. The CPS puts its prosecutorial interest first and not the interest of civil justice. The claimant and defendant can have a reasonable idea of the sort of legal/ public policy the judiciary is keen to uphold. The parties cannot know the minds of prosecutors. In effect then, it may be argued that while there is a jurisprudential basis between the approach adopted by Australian and UK courts, there is no big practical difference in terms of their application. Recall that in AT&amp;T Istel Ltd, the majority reiterated an obvious point: that the CPS cannot be bound by a court order Against its will. 24 As the CPS is unlikely to give such undertaking (noted there aren’t any comprehensive survey or study on this), the current approach of the E&amp;W courts means most claimants will win an injunction but practically an ineffective one. Justice and fairnessThe current English approach may also be criticized for standing justice on its own head when a civil court makes an order that’s binding on the criminal court. The majority in Reid v Howard stated that “it is inimical to the administration of justice for a civil court to compel self-incriminatory disclosure, while fashioning orders to prevent the use of the information thus obtained in a court vested with criminal jurisdiction with respect to the matters disclosed”. 25 The majority objects to an order preventing the prosecutor from using such disclosed evidence in criminal prosecution. Lord Wilberforce stated a different concern in Rank Film: “I cannot accept that a civil court has any power to decide in a manner which would bind a criminal court that evidence of any kind is admissible or inadmissible in that court. ”26 His Lordship’s objection is directed at a civil court binding a criminal court. To assess the strength of both objections, it is proposed that one look at AT&amp;T Istel Ltd. In AT&amp;T Istel Ltd, the High Court fashioned an order preventing the use of the information disclosed from being used in criminal prosecution of the defendant. The exact words used are: “No disclosure made in compliance with paragraphs 18 to 32 inclusive of this order shall be used as evidence in the prosecution of the offence alleged to have been committed by the person required to make that disclosure or by any spouse of that person. ”27  Arguably, the wording does not compel the criminal court into rejecting such evidence, but rather it prevents the prosecution, by their own undertaking, from adducing such evidence for the criminal court’s consideration in the first place at the threat of contempt. It is therefore possible to protect both the defendant and claimant’s interest without falling foul of Lord Wilberforce’s concern. As to the majority’s concern in Reid, it is questionable whether it is really “inimical” to justice to order disclosure while limiting its use. It is not uncommon that the use of disclosed information in civil proceedings is limited. For instance, there’s the trite general rule that documents obtained during discovery must be used for the purpose of the litigation at hand only. It is therefore not necessarily against the interest of justice to limit the use of documents to the conduct of the civil litigation. Statutory reformHowever, is statute in the form of prevention of use the way to move forward? Of course it depends on the wording of a provision. But any statutory reform must address problems including but not limited to ones discussed in this short piece. Lord Neuberger MR in Gray28 and Professor Andrews29 supported statutory reform along the lines of section 72(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981. The section applies in a passing off or infringement of IP rights action. The PSI was abrogated and replaced by a prohibition against its use in subsequent prosecution of related criminal offence30. Section 72(3) reads: “…no statement or admission made by a person— (a)in answering a question put to him in any proceedings to which subsection (1) applies; or (b)in complying with any order made in any such proceedings, shall, in proceedings for any related offence or for the recovery of any related penalty, be admissible in evidence against that person…” It is submitted that there may be two obvious problems for a section 72(3) approach. Firstly, there must be a clear supervision of the scope of disclosure. It should not be used by defendants to disclose evidence not necessarily required under the order. This may potentially become a haven for preventing the prosecution from relying on evidence that should’ve been admissible at trial. One way to do this may add a discretion to the trial judge to allow an evidence if it is clear that such evidence is not so covered under the order. The danger for the defendant is to only disclose what is necessarily required, this can be achieved if the court makes a clear order as to specific information or documents to be disclosed. Secondly, there does not seem to be a residual discretion to disallow disclosure. Such discretion may be called for, for instance, when the CPS prosecution will likely collapse because of the precluded evidence. It is not unthinkable that the CPS may obtain the evidence from a different source before a disclosure order is made. The order would preclude the use of such independently obtained evidence from being adduced. The interest of the CPS would certainly be undermined by this broad-brush approach. Such a problem cannot be addressed by asking what one values more: catching the bad guys or protecting the innocent. It is a policy consideration that must be undertaken by the legislature. It is submitted that statutory reform is, however, preferable to existing common law approach. Firstly, it addresses the reluctance of some judges in limiting the common law PSI right. This benefit is perhaps less important in England &amp; Wales since the highest court has not shared such concern. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, statutory reform would solve the practicality objection. The CPS will no longer be the de facto arbiter of whether a claimant gets a relief where the defendant asserts PSI. It also means that the legal certainty objection is also met. Of course, this is assuming Parliament reforms the law along the lines of section 72(3). Secondly, it addresses the problem of the E&amp;W approach where the CPS retains a discretion which ultimately affects whether the claimant gets the disclosure order. As noted above, the court cannot bind the CPS unless the CPS gives a voluntary undertaking to court. Such that the effect of the E&amp;W approach is not so different to the Australian one since the CPS has little incentive to give such undertaking. A statutory provision would resolve this current discrepancy between principle and practice. Taking stock from the foregoing discussion, it is hoped the readers are at least persuaded the current common law approaches (both E&amp;W and Australia) are problematic and needs urgent reform. The PSI deserves protection by our legal system, yet it should be relied on to categorically undermine the effectiveness of civil process. Since courts cannot bind the prosecution without its consent, statutory reform is needed to ensure the aim of PSI is served: to prevent use of disclosed information in subsequent criminal prosecution of the defendant for a related offence. It is prime time for this reform.  [1]Prof. John Sorabji, “Calling time on the privilege against self-incrimination in civil proceedings?” (2012) 31 CJQ 261. [2]Ibid. [3]378 US 52 (1964). [4]Ibid.

    "title": "The delicate balance between Carl Schmitt’s constituent power and liberal constitutionalism: a misunderstood and over-complicated dichotomy?",
    "body": "2019/09/23 - The tension between constituent power and a liberal theory of constitutionalism is important in constitutional theory as they paint very different perceptions of the nature of authority in a constitution. Constituent power is “the power through which the prince’s power to rule was authorised,”1 and its primary function is to “specify in constitutional language the ultimate source of authority of the state. ”2 This article focuses on the work of Carl Schmitt, as it is suggested as a “powerful corrective to the distortions of normativism. ”3 It is clearly anti-liberal and decisionist, providing a direct ground for critical evaluation of the alleged tension. In a similar vein, calls for executive action and/or dominance in times of emergency or crisis renders it necessary to understand whether the assumption of (near) absolute power by the executive in such times entails the death of liberal constitutionalism. 4 This article argues that the concept of constituent power is only anathema to liberal constitutionalism if their relationship is conceived as dichotomous without any mutually inclusive aspects. Three arguments will be made. Firstly, by analysing Schmitt’s conception of constituent power and its perceived contradistinctions against liberal constitutionalism, it will be shown that the relationship between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism is dichotomous only if constituent power is conceived as external to the legal order. It will then narrow down the focus to the issue of emergency, contending that it does not require the law to recede and be totally suspended, and the concept of constituent power can be reconciled with liberal constitutionalism. Last but not the least, using the recent rumors of the use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (Cap. 241) (“ERO”) by the Hong Kong Government to deal with various protests and clashes since early June 2019, it will be shown that limitations on the Executive’s power is crucial in order for Schmitt’s concept of constituent power and a liberal theory of constitutionalism to be reconciled. This article will come to the conclusion that Schmitt’s refusal to recognise the broader political and legal contexts underpinning the concept of constituent power is the main reason why it may be anathema to liberal constitutionalism. Schmitt’s unnecessarily dichotomous conception of the relationship between constituent power and a liberal theory of constitutionalism For Schmitt, the sovereign bears constituent power: “sovereign is he who decides on the exception,”5 which cannot be derived solely from a general norm. It is a power which has the ultimate say in a political regime, unconstrained by any norms. His insistence on constituent power as the subject of a constitution denies the possibility of a closed, purely normative constitutional system. 6 From this stance, it is unmistakable that Schmitt is antagonistic against a liberal theory of constitutionalism. The sovereign decision is the absolute beginning. His conception of constituent power is clearly anathema to liberal constitutionalism. Taken to its logical extreme, Schmitt’s conception of constituent power in Political Theology forms the basis for an “authoritarian exceptionless exception. ”7 Based on the omnipotence of the sovereign, it has the absolute discretion to determine what “constitutes” an exception, without any constraints from any other parties, rules, or norms whatsoever. The untrammeled absolute power the sovereign enjoys here in determining what constitutes an exception and what to do with such “exception” illustrates the possibly endless power the sovereign may be said to possess.   This is an accurate observation as the exception which the sovereign decides on may be easily normalised as a daily occurrence. The power to authorise so is unchecked. The utilisation of extraordinary powers in cases of the now-normalised “exceptional” circumstances is antagonistic against a liberal constitutionalist’s propositions for checks and balances and rooting the foundation of extraordinary powers in a legal source. Before proceeding to scrutinise Schmitt’s propositions, a liberal theory of constitutionalism should first be introduced. In contradistinction to Schmitt’s absolutist picture, Friedrich Hayek offers a remarkably liberal and norm-based theory of constitutionalism. For Hayek, the authority of a legislator should rest on something distinguished from “an act of will on a particular matter in hand. ”8 Such authority cannot rest solely upon the discretion of the legislator himself. Instead, such power “rests on a common opinion about certain attributes which the laws he produces ought to possess. ”9 The power must be shaped and/or contributed by such attributes, instead of stemming from any unpredictable and variable absolute discretion of a legislator. Moreover, there is no logical necessity that the ultimate power must be omnipotent. Such ultimate power is “a negative power, but as a power of withholding allegiance it limits all positive power. ”10 The ultimate authority authorising all actions of the government constraints the government’s actions. The only true side of law is nomos, and it should neither dictate nor direct the actions of the people. For Schmitt, the true side of law is thesis — the law of will: imposed organisation. Schmitt’s main attack on liberalism is based on the inevitable existence of the exception. There is no normative basis which it may be seen to rest or be constrained on. What Schmitt fails to realise, however, is that his dichotomous conception of the relationship between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism has blinded him from the position the former has within the latter. Loughlin recognised11 that for Schmitt, the significance of constituent power lies in the fact that the state continues to evolve, expressing “the principle of dynamic emergence of political unity, of the process of constantly renewed formation and emergence of this unity from a fundamental or ultimately effective power …”. 12 Constituent power also expresses the formative process by which that sovereign will exhibits itself through time. 13 Here is where Schmitt misses the point: the formative process of exhibition and decision-making can and necessarily have recourse to legal norms; there can be fundamental norms which the sovereign is subjected to. The authorisation from constituent power in terms of the decisions that can be adopted can nevertheless be subjected to liberal norms, such as the rule of law. For example, the collective autonomy of the people to uphold the rule of law can control the exercise of ultimate authority for the purpose of upholding the desired norms. Schmitt, however, only focused on the formation of the unity itself, but not the role of this unity in conferring power to the government. The formation of the unity and its authorisation of the ruler’s power are separate questions, but Schmitt’s conflation of them has blinded him from the possibility of liberal norms underpinning the authorisation of power. The collective autonomy of the people as vested in the ruler to make decisions does not have to be dichotomised with the norms that the community of people decides to uphold. From this lens, the exercise of constituent power is part of the liberal constitutional order. This gives crucial insight into the second inquiry of this article: the conception of constituent power in the context of emergency. The peaceful co-existence of constituent power and liberal constitutionalism in times of emergency The recent expanded uses of emergency power that suspend normal constitutional protections have rejuvenated interest on Schmitt’s distinction between the norm and exception as the analytical framework for relevant constitutional measures. 14 For Schmitt, the exception can be “best characterised as a case of extreme peril…It cannot be circumscribed factually and made to conform to a preformed law. ”15 If actions in an emergency are not subject to controls, which a liberal theory of constitutionalism would require, it should become clear who the sovereign is. 16 In order for the executive to respond to emergencies effectively, constituent power must be unlimited in authorising the range of responses it can offer, regardless of extremity. The exception is characterised by principally unlimited authority, entailing the suspension of the entire existing legal order: “the state remains, whereas the law recedes. ”17 Constituent power gives unlimited authority for the ruler to do whatever he deems necessary: it is not subjected to controls of any sort. This contrasts with a liberal constitutionalist’s, for example Hayek, claim that such exercise of power should still be constrained. The key is to limit the power that authorises the government’s powers and actions. The need to decide on the exception emphasises the central role of political decision-makers who decide on how to deal with it on a case-by-case basis. Schmitt’s conception of constituent power “denies that law’s authority can be found on the intrinsic qualities of legal order. ”18 His account, however, is flawed; by correcting this logical fallacy, the tension between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism can be resolved. To begin with, Dyzenhaus noted that Schmitt was unable to locate authority in something external because it is “drawn to claim that the basis is quasi-legal. ”19 This is reflected in Schmitt’s insistence for a normal situation to exist in order to determine whether the nation is still in a normal situation or it has entered into a state of emergency. In deciding so, the executive has to start from the norm, which delineates the normal situations of a constitutional order. This is because the power authorising the government’s power to make emergency measures has, at the very minimum, part of its basis in the norm itself. Without recourse to or starting from the general norm, the exception may become the norm itself, as it has nothing to be “exceptional” from. Given the necessary involvement of a “norm,” the concept of constituent power can therefore be reconciled with liberal constitutionalism. The power which authorises the executive to adopt emergency measures does not spring out from nowhere, but from the norm underpinning the normal situation as recognised by the liberal constitution. For example, for a liberal state to declare martial law, it is necessary for the power making the decision to enter into a state of emergency to find in the general norm situations or conditions which allow such state of emergency to be declared. The move from a state of normal law to martial law has to start with an examination of the normal law itself, and whether its inability to tackle the alleged emergency warrants exceptions to be made to the normal law. However, to further rescue the concept of constituent power from Schmitt’s extreme stance, it is necessary to briefly examine his views on the influence of politics on law. Schmitt’s systematic thinking, in reducing the concept of the “political” to “friend” and “enemy,” has led him to conceive emergency, based on constituent power, as a “battering ram”20 against liberal democracy. His conception of law, that “all law is ‘situational law,’“21 is “intrinsically bound up with a political struggle. ”22 Once the “struggle” of the exception triumphs over the normal situation, the latter is seen as “defeated;” the exception’s “victory” awards the executive an unlimited authorisation to enact emergency measures. It is questionable, however, whether the concept of “political” has to be reduced to “friend” and “enemy” in order to justify the application of emergency measures. As Scheuerman observes, Schmitt’s analysis of emergency government “neglects its complex political origins. ”23 It focuses excessively on the formation and constant renewal of the power itself, neglecting any common interests which competing concerns in politics may have or compromise on.   Here is where liberal constitutionalism can provide an answer: to safeguard the sustainability of the norms the liberal constitutional order is found on. Once the focus of constituent power is broadened to encapsulate the objectives of the authorising the use of emergency powers and “malleable recent social trends,”24 instead of only pestering on the formation and history of constituent power itself, it may be re-conceptualised as the starting point for ending the exceptional situation and return to the normal order. Historical givens, despite providing a solid ground for a framework of exception, is inadequate. It tends to neglect the reasons for emergency and the objectives of emergency measures. The stakeholders within the “political” do not have to be dichotomised into an opposing relationship of friend and enemy. Once the competing interests underlying norms and exceptions are no longer contradistinguished from one another in the Schmittian sense, constituent power can be reconciled with a liberal theory of constitutionalism in acknowledging the existence of mutually competing interests. No particular stance and interests would enjoy an absolute status over another. In order to reconcile with the concept of constituent power, liberal constitutionalists should view the state of emergency as “a crucial tool enabling public reassurance in the short run without creating long-run damage to foundational commitments to freedom and the rule of law. ”25 Constituent power, as the ultimate authority for the executive to act for the purpose of safeguarding commitments to liberal ideals, works alongside liberal constitutionalism to correct the state the exceptional situation and return it to normal. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance (Cap. 241) The ERO empowers the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to enact a wide but exhaustive range of regulations26 “whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest. ”27 Any regulations made under section 2(2) would, moreover, be “continue in force until repealed by order of the Chief Executive in Council. ”28 Moreover, any regulations enacted under section 2(2) would “have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment. ”29 When read together, sections 2(2) and 2(3) or 2(4) would suggest that unlimited power is bestowed upon the Chief Executive in the selected area(s) (s)he chooses to legislate on. Instead of being limited by any external restraints (say, for example, a judicial review action which, given the generality of the language under the ERO, is unlikely to succeed), the Chief Executive has unlimited power to legislate in any terms (s)he desires to be in the public interest. Moreover, the language of section 2(1) epitomises Schmitt’s conception of the exception. Instead of requiring any approval by any other institutional bodies, for example the Executive Council or the Legislative Council, the power to make regulations under section 2(1) only refers to the Chief Executive himself and himself only. This opens the possibility of a significant threat being posed to the liberties which citizens would ordinarily enjoy – in times of alleged emergency or public danger, civil liberties may be disregarded significantly (if not completely) and there are no executive or legislative checks against it. Section 2(3) provides the only statutory method for terminating a regulation enacted under section 2(1) and 2(2) of the ERO. This means that the termination of any emergency regulation would, on a literal interpretation of the Ordinance, be at the absolute discretion of the Chief Executive in Council. Whilst any predictions to the Chief Executive’s use of the Ordinance is beyond the scope of this article, it is sufficient to note that the civil liberties of over seven million Hong Kong citizens would lie in her sole discretion. The lack of any principles or rules guiding the return to normalcy under the Ordinance further exposes the potential dangers to liberal constitutionalism posed by the Ordinance. Instead of being required to repeal any emergency regulations over a particular period of time, or inserting mandatorily such regulations with sunset clauses, the Ordinance provides no hints as to normalcy can and should be achieved (or returned to) once the emergency regulations are enacted. Any approaches to the Ordinance and the enactment of regulations must, for at least the purpose of restoring the stability and orderliness of the Hong Kong society, bear in mind the protection of a liberal constitutional order and the integrity of the legal system. Conclusion Constituent power is a powerful concept in illustrating the ultimate authority of the state and justifying the ruler’s authority to act. Schmitt’s wickedly ingenious illustration of the unlimitedness of the exception and its authority to respond to emergencies, whilst compelling, risks unnecessarily dichotomising the relationship between constituent power and liberal constitutionalism. Although a thorough examination of Schmitt’s conception and critique against it cannot be examined in the limited space of this article, it is clear that the concept of constituent power is not anathema to a theory of liberal constitutionalism: they can work together to uphold the liberal constitutional order, and safeguard it from falling into a permanent state of emergency.

    "title": "Material contribution: bridging the evidentiary gap",
    "body": "2019/09/15 - To right a private wrong, causation is generally established between the tortfeasor’s negligent act and claimant’s injury. However, on occasion, the evidence will be such that a causal link is difficult or even impossible to prove by the traditional approach. Material contribution has emerged in tort law to attempt to impose liability where causation is hard to prove in the usual manner, or where applying traditional causation would lead to an undesirable outcome. It is needed to protect vulnerable claimants who should not be barred from seeking remedy merely because their particular circumstances make it harder for them to obtain damages. A comparison of traditional factual causation with material contribution shows how the underlying principles of protecting the claimant are compatible without direct causation. Despite not being a traditional test of causation, material contribution in the law of tort is still needed to solve the problem of an evidentiary gap when the but-for test is insufficient to impose liability where it is desirable. Moreover, it may still be possible to show some level of causal link between the defendant’s negligence and the claimant’s injury. The but-for test is the traditional method of proving factual causation in tort law, such as that applied in Barnett v Chelsea and Kensington Hospital Committee. 1 It aims to show the connection between the defendant’s breach and the claimant’s loss in order to justify the defendant being held liable for that loss. The test requires a burden of proof on a balance of probabilities2 and disregards conditions which are ‘part of the normal environment’. 3 It tends to take into account the phenomena of multiple causes and divisible injuries, and arguably aims to hold tortfeasors accountable for the damage that they have caused by their negligence to the claimant. In Barnett, Neild J found that the defendant’s negligence did not cause the victim’s death; but for the defendant’s breach of the duty of care, the same outcome of the victim’s death by arsenic poisoning would have occurred. 4 In Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw, Lord Reid stated that ‘what is a material contribution must be a question of degree’. 5 He observed that if a factor was too important an issue to fall under the de minimis non curat lex exception, then it could not be too small to be considered immaterial. Jane Stapleton has pointed out that there remains some ambiguity which can be outlined in three scenarios, two of which follow orthodox causation and one of which is more difficult to resolve. 6 This will be explored in the context of multiple tortfeasors, such as where the victim was in the employ of multiple firms over his career and exposed to dangerous materials. In the first situation, total injury is divisible: it is possible to determine who caused which part of the claimant’s injury and apportion damages accordingly. Divisible injuries take into account how severe the injury is and whether and how each tortfeasor’s actions exacerbated the harm.  In addition, the alternative approach of the quantification of damages considers ‘the fact that absent the breach this precise total condition would not have been suffered’. 7 However, quantification is not necessarily the best approach to take because of the complex problems it poses in terms of proof: ‘where the disease manifests itself many years after the exposure … much of the detail is inevitably lost’. 8 The second type of case involves indivisible total injury, where each defendant is found jointly and severally liable for the entire injury. In both of these cases, there is a causal link between each defendant’s act and the claimant’s injury; imposing liability upon the defendants for the harm they are shown to be responsible for should not be controversial. The third situation is more controversial because it has features from each of the first two scenarios that usually arise. Unlike in Bonnington, this principle concerns material contribution to the risk of injury as opposed to material contribution to injury itself. On one hand, each tortfeasor’s act contributes to an accumulation of risk of the claimant contracting the disease. On the other hand, the injury is indivisible because once manifested, the disease’s effects are the same regardless of the victim’s history of exposure. It is also unclear at which point along the line of exposure the victim actually contracted the disease, so it is harder to find one defendant directly responsible for the disease itself. These conditions are relevant in cases where the claimant suffers or even dies from mesothelioma, for example, a medical condition caused by the inhalation of asbestos to which certain employers may negligently expose their employees. Difficulty in finding liability is problematic because the role of the court in tort law should be to allow private wrongs to be compensated without being fettered by scientific impossibilities or evidentiary gaps. Therefore, concepts such as material contribution to risk of injury and material contribution to injury have been developed and should be retained to combat the tension. Authorities have equated the material contribution to risk of injury with causation. For example, in Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd, material contribution to the risk of injury was a sufficient causal connection and was equivalent to a material contribution to the disease despite the ‘inability to prove what is scientifically unprovable’. 9 The Fairchild principle clashes with the but-for test: the claimant was unable to show which defendant caused the harm on a balance of probabilities; it was necessary to create an exception without involving but-for causation. On balance, accepting that there was a causal link despite the evidentiary gap would have led to a fairer outcome than failing to compensate the claimant for an injury that was definitely caused by a wrongdoer. Although the court’s preference for policies to protect claimants and warn employers is understandable, it seemed to remain unclear that there was direct causality. This could imply that the legal test has become easier to satisfy when the traditional test cannot be applied. However, it would be counterintuitive to argue that there was no causal link between the tortfeasors’ actions and the claimant’s injury at all, because in that case the claimant’s disease would have - impossibly - been caused by nothing! In cases such as this, not only is material contribution necessary to impose liability on irresponsible tortfeasors, but it is a test that results in a net positive. Penalising employers for increasing the risk of an injury is justified when in fact that injury materialises, even if that must be squared with liability for increasing the risk of an injury without an actual resulting harm being less reasonable. Similarly, material contribution to injury has also been understood to equal causing the injury, as was decided in Williams v Bermuda Hospitals Board. 10 Since the patient was already suffering from sepsis before the hospital’s negligence, it was unclear that the breach of duty made the injury itself worse. This would have rendered the but-for test useless to the claimant: but for the hospital’s negligence, the patient could still have suffered the same injuries from sepsis. A strict application of the but-for test would bar the claimant from seeking damages. However, the hospital’s negligence did lead to the build up of more sepsis which materially contributed to the state of affairs, potentially causing more injury to the patient’s heart and lungs. By extending the principle of causation to include material contribution, the court was able to allow redress. In some cases of over-determination, applying the but-for test could create the false negative reasoning that but for one’s conduct, the claimant still could have died from the other’s conduct, leading to neither defendant being held liable. Richard Wright’s NESS (necessary element of a sufficient set) test aims to determine whether the defendant’s conduct was significant enough to attract liability in a ‘sufficient set’ of factors. 11 This test attempts to establish a historical connection between the tortious conduct and its outcome; thus, it has many similarities to causation. Jane Stapleton has suggested a more accessible ‘targeted but-for test’, which removes complicating factors to satisfy the but-for test. For example, by removing one defendant from the equation, the other defendant would be able to satisfy the but-for test. 12 This explains how each factor can be historically involved in an outcome even though the other factor could have been responsible. Thus, an element of causation is retained. Perhaps the difference between material contribution and the but-for test should be reconciled by establishing material contribution as an alternative test or, as Stephen Bailey suggests, a particular application of but-for causation in cases of cumulatively-caused injury. 13 If material contribution were an alternative test of causation, it would ask the question of factual causation through a normative lens, so that a court could still impose liability where an evidentiary gap makes it difficult to apply the but-for test. Alternatively, it could be argued that material contribution is not another test for causation. Rather, it is the exceptional imposition of liability in the absence of causation. In mesothelioma cases, because the symptoms may take years to materialise, although the cancer is linked to asbestos exposure, the ability to prove that a defendant’s negligence caused the claimant’s injury is severely compromised. This was exposed in Barker v Corus UK Ltd, where an ‘innocent’ potential cause for the claimant’s mesothelioma was present. 14 In Fairchild, it seemed to be certain that at least one defendant would be responsible. Of course, it should be noted that Stapleton holds the view that the ‘defendant could always in theory point to environmental exposures’. 15 In Barker, there was truly a chance that none of the defendants were responsible. Therefore, the court’s aim might not have been to hold the defendants liable for the damage caused; their decision seemed to place emphasis on warning employers against a breach of duty. This policy approach, which considerably disregards causation as the deciding factor in favour of warning other employers against irresponsible behaviour, could be undesirable and even raise fair labelling issues: even in the face of an innocent cause, the law considers the defendants as if they were directly responsible for the claimant’s injury. Although it could be argued that such a policy approach still relies on a causal link to attach responsibility to employers who place their workers in dangerous working conditions, in cases such as Barker, the claimant does not seem to have to fulfil the normal standard of proof at all. Imposing liability without a proven causal link would establish material contribution as an court-created exception outside the scope of causation. In light of new legislation which imposes the whole of the damage upon all defendants, this development in tort law may go too far. 16 Draconian consequences are created in cases where even a small increase to the risk of mesothelioma may result in the defendant having to pay full damages. 17 Material contribution must have a place in the law today as it promotes the policy of compensating those who have suffered grave harm. Logistical problems arising from imposing liability cannot outweigh the injustice of denying victims redress. As a means for the courts to impose liability, material contribution does not mean that causation cannot be proved. In situations such as mesothelioma claims, the courts are merely required to expand their understanding of causation beyond the traditional but-for approach in order to accommodate for evidentiary gaps.

    "title": "Afghanistan: Towards wider interests of justice?",
    "body": "2019/09/01 - The Pre-Trial Chamber (“PTC”) II of the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) handed down its much-awaited decision on the request for authorisation of an investigation into the situation in Afghanistan1 earlier this year. The escalating conflict in Afghanistan has generated thousands of civilian casualties, many of whom were also victims of acts potentially constituting war crimes within the ICC’s jurisdiction. 2 The decision that the investigation would not be in the interests of justice to pursue thus came as a surprise to the legal community, given the presumed dormancy of the provision – many had thought that any admissible case would ipso facto be in the interests of justice to pursue. Indeed, it was widely assumed that the decision would only be subject to review by the PTC where the Office of the Prosecutor (“OTP”) had decided not to pursue an investigation solely in the interests of justice. 3 This case note will analyse the role of state cooperation in the PTC’s interests of justice determination in light of the principle of complementarity, which holds that the ICC should only intervene where a State Party was “unwilling or unable”4 to investigate a crime falling under the ICC’s jurisdiction. The objectives of domestic institution-building that the principle was conceived of to foster will be considered, before concluding that the PTC’s overt focus on prosecutorial success is misguided. The CaseThe OTP submitted the request to authorise a proprio motu investigation into the ongoing situation in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (“Afghanistan”) in November 2017, pursuant to Article 15(3) of the Rome Statute. 5 The escalating conflict in Afghanistan has raged on for almost two decades, with what started as a Taliban insurgency spreading into a guerrilla-style war drawing in actors from beyond the state’s borders, including the US and other international forces. The investigation concerned alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in the territory of Afghanistan, and was classified into three “categories” according to the different groups allegedly responsible for the crimes, namely (i) the Taliban and other armed groups, (ii) Afghan Forces, and (iii) US Forces and the CIA. The PTC examined whether there was a “reasonable basis to proceed” as per Article 53(1)6 by assessing jurisdiction, admissibility, and whether it served the interests of justice to undertake the investigation. For an investigation to be admissible, it needs to meet the admissibility criteria of gravity and complementarity. The PTC, uncontroversially and in line with general academic consensus, agreed with the majority of the OTP’s arguments, going so far as to make positive determinations on both the jurisdiction and admissibility requirements – only to subsequently deem that there were “substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice”. 7 The PTC proceeded to list three factors considered in arriving at the determination: (1) significant time elapsed between alleged crimes and the Request, (2) scarce cooperation obtained by OTP, and (3) accessibility of relevant evidence and potential relevant suspects to the investigation. 8 In relation to factors 1 and 3, the PTC cited the long preliminary examination, the lack of action towards the preservation of evidence, and the worsening political situation in Afghanistan complicating the process of obtaining evidence. 9 On the issue of scarce state cooperation, which is the main focus for the purposes of this note, it was deemed that changes within the political landscape in Afghanistan and key States made it “difficult to gauge the prospects of securing meaningful cooperation from relevant authorities for the future”. In particular, the OTP’s “difficulties in securing albeit minimal cooperation from the relevant authorities” were noted. 10 The above factors were said to “possibly compromis[e] [the OTP’s] chances for success”. 11 As such, the PTC was of the opinion that “the prospects for a successful investigation and prosecution [were] extremely limited”. 12 It was postulated that the failure of such an investigation could in turn create “frustration and possibly hostility vis-à-vis the Court”,13 negatively impacting the ICC’s ability to credibly pursue the objectives it was created to serve. Such was the reasoning that ultimately led to the conclusion that it would not be in the interests of justice to pursue the investigation. Questionable points of law could be raised concerning the PTC’s treatment of state cooperation in relation to the principle of complementarity, and the wide interpretation of the interests of justice provision to equate it with the institutional preservation of the ICC. State Cooperation and ComplementarityThe extent of state cooperation (or lack thereof) is apparent from the OTP’s preliminary examinations, and reflects varying levels of willingness to cooperate according to the “category” that was being pursued. As regards Taliban forces, the OTP noted efforts taken by the Afghan government to “build its capacity to meet its obligations under the Rome Statute” and to “facilitate national investigations and prosecutions of ICC crimes”. 14 Among these efforts included the update of the country’s Criminal Procedure Code, and a new Penal Code Bill incorporating Rome Statute crimes and specifying superior responsibility. 15 Afghan authorities showed more restraint in proceedings against members of the Afghan Forces. Whilst a “limited number” of proceedings had been instituted, all cases were eventually dismissed. 16 Although the national proceedings have been found to be insufficient, there is little to indicate that authorities would have shown resistance to cooperation if the case were brought to the international plane, given previous co-operation with other international bodies including the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT)17 and UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. 18 In a contrasting vein, reports concerning the willingness of US authorities to cooperate are a vastly different matter. From the outset, the OTP stated that specific information on national proceedings were sought from US authorities but “not receive[d]”,19 leaving it unable to obtain sufficient information “despite a number of efforts taken”. 20 The OTP thus had to rely on publicly available information contained in open sources on which to base its report. A common theme of US obstinacy was notable throughout the OTP’s assessment. This included CAT observations that the US provided “minimal statistics” and insufficient information leading to an inability to assess compliance,21 and the delay of a Polish Prosecutor General’s investigation into a CIA detention facility on its territory due to “a lack of US Government cooperation”. 22 Indeed, it appears that the PTC’s references to the difficulty in seeking the cooperation of “relevant authorities”23 was its implicit and diplomatic way of referring to US authorities. In and of itself, the decision to factor in a state’s willingness to cooperate with ICC investigators is already dubious, insofar as it is a consideration of extra-legal and prudential factors. 24 Seen through the lens of complementarity, however, the decision could arguably be said to turn everything the ICC was founded to stand for on its head. The principle of complementarity was a founding cornerstone25 of the Rome Statute, giving states primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute core international crimes. The OTP has largely taken a “positive” approach to complementarity, taking the stance that not only should State Parties retain this primary responsibility, but that they should be encouraged, or induced, to do so where possible. An ethos of domestic accountability and capacity-building is thus emphasised in the ICC’s fight against impunity. 26 However, the decision not to authorise an investigation on the basis of lack of state cooperation – in other words, accountability – not only excuses such behaviour, but encourages such behaviour. As a “court of last resort”, it is the raison d’être of the ICC to be able to extend its reach where others cannot. This notion is seen in many features of the court, such as its potential for universal jurisdiction27 or its ability to override immunity. 28 Complementarity can be conceived of as a spectrum – with governments that are willing and able on one end, and governments that are significantly unwilling or unable on the other. It is at this further end where the larger proportion of impunity gaps would have existed pre-ICC. 29 It is this amalgamation of factors that makes trying difficult cases – that is, cases which might prove difficult to investigate due to absence of state cooperation – inherent to the role of the ICC. When following the doctrine of command responsibility or dealing with officials with immunity, the individual in question is almost always going to have a certain level of authority within the state. The principle of complementarity meanwhile filters cases such that the admissibility of an investigation is predicated on there having been a minimum level of domestic resistance to delivering justice. Oftentimes, the impunity normally is so grave that is goes to the very heart of the state’s exercise of sovereign prerogatives,30 and it is this quality that warrants the domestic extrication of the case and its elevation to the international fora. All factors considered, this leaves the ICC in a position where state cooperation is hard to come by. Lack of state cooperation unfortunately is part and parcel of the job. In the context of this case, a third new level of state cooperation which determines whether an investigation will proceed has been created. The first is where a state is cooperative such that initiative is taken to undertake sufficient domestic proceedings. Such investigations will be deemed inadmissible for reasons of complementarity and the case tried domestically. The second is where it is domestically deficient, but cooperates internationally. The domestic deficiency is necessary for a positive determination of admissibility, and proceedings are brought before the ICC. These two constitute the traditional complementarity binary. The Afghanistan case has introduced a third layer, where the state is domestically deficient and refuses to cooperate internationally, so much so that it goes beyond legal questions of complementarity and admissibility, and it is deemed “not in the interests of justice” to proceed with the investigation. This setback for promoting accountability and capacity-building in domestic institutions is two-fold because of the cooperation of the Afghan government. This is particularly so in relation to allegations against Taliban Forces, with authorities having made efforts to build its capacity to facilitate prosecutions. Where in other cases the ICC had taken the opportunity to engage constructively,31 in the present case they have washed their hands of the situation, whilst simultaneously rewarding the US for its obstructive ways. In this context, the determination on interests of justice functions as the anti-complementarity provision, stipulating that it is acceptable not to cooperate with investigations even if a state seeks to avoid standing before the ICC, as long as they are sufficiently uncooperative so that an investigation is not in the “interests of justice”. In other instances, complementarity is “intended to preserve the ICC’s power over irresponsible states that refuse to prosecute those who commit heinous crimes”,32 and it is against that refusal that the ICC carries on its fight against impunity. The fluidity with which a lack of state cooperation can be construed to fit into either of these narratives is a dangerous tool of unfettered discretion. Given previous similar instances involving other recalcitrant states,33 it is hard to defend against accusations of US exceptionalism, and the Courts need to be wary of the danger of it becoming a “one rule for them, another for us” situation. Besides the danger it poses for the legitimacy of the ICC, the practical implications of factoring state cooperation into decisions are extensive as well. The lack of cooperation from national authorities in the ICTY trials provides a glimpse into potential repercussions, such as the confinement of successful cases to that of low-ranking officials. 34 Further, more cases are likely to be tried ex post facto, after the criminal incidents have come to a conclusion and normally as a product of regime change when authorities begin to cooperate, as was the case in Serbia,35 which means the ICC might have a limited ability to make an actual difference to the situation whilst it is ongoing. Successful Investigations: In the Interests of Justice?Of course, in the examples drawn from the ICTY, the relevant individuals already had cases brought against them, so the reality is that the presence of an investigation made little practical difference. Even if the Afghanistan investigation had been authorised, it would have been doomed to failure from lack of state cooperation. This is the utilitarian argument the PTC employ – since the consequences would be the same anyhow, resources should be conserved and efforts should be focussed on successful prosecutions. This approach provides relief to the ICC’s tattered reputation,36 and perhaps instils better hope for its continued institutional functioning, given the criticism received from delayed investigations and the fact that the ICC has only ever produced three convictions that have survived appellate review. 37 Alongside political threats levelled by US authorities,38 there was the overwhelming sense that this was simply not a battle that the ICC had the wherewithal to face: “[T]he Court is not meant - or equipped - to address any and all scenarios where the most serious international crimes might have been committed; therefore, focussing on those scenarios where the prospects for successful and meaningful investigations are serious and substantive is key to its ultimate success. ”39 However, even if makes no practical difference to the outcome, to refuse to authorise the investigation would be to legally permit the outcome. The concept of the ICC was founded on the idea of a body which upholds a set of fundamental norms by punishing certain jus cogens wrongs which shock the global conscience of mankind. 40 This normative flavour in theory presupposes leaving no room for derogation, yet the decision not to authorise an investigation on the basis of prudential reasons overrides the moral imperative underlying the norms in question. In doing this, the ICC has lost its status as signaller of international normative standards to states. Not too long ago was it claimed that the most serious situations are chosen41 for investigation, so as to make examples42 and fulfil the Court’s didactic legalist function. Such endeavours have now been sacrificed on the altar of its newfound focus on “successful” investigations, under the guise of interests of justice. Yet despite its wide construction of the interests of justice provision, the PTC has taken a rather narrow view of what justice could entail. The ICC’s overarching objective of the “effective prosecution of the most serious international crimes, the fight against impunity and the prevention of mass atrocities”43 was relied upon to justify the prioritisation of state compliance. To reduce justice to the continued existence of the ICC, and by extension a mere quantum of successful investigations, is misguided. The problem here is the conflation of compliance with effectiveness,44 in assuming that the ICC would be most effectively able to uphold the norms it espouses through higher levels of state compliance. In reality, the concept of justice reaches much further than the bounds of the ICC as an institution, and relinquishing this institutional egocentrism might allow for the realisation of justice on a wider level. The traditional Austinian view which sees the ICC as only as powerful as its coercive power is perhaps lacking, and a wider view takes into account its political influence on state behaviour. The principle of complementarity serves as a humble reminder of this, and coupled with the ICC’s norm-signalling function, encourages the pursuit of justice on a national level and leaves the ICC as a court of last resort. As the OTP once remarked: “As a consequence of complementarity the number of cases that reach the court should not be a measure of its efficiency. On the contrary, the absence of trials before this court, as a consequence of the regular functioning of national institutions, would be a major success. ”45 Perhaps the greatest irony lies in the fact that the attainment of the ICC’s core objective might be best achieved in a world where it has little need to be employed. ConclusionThe interests of justice determination in the PTC’s Afghanistan ruling seemed a knee-jerk ruling seeking the institutional preservation of the ICC, in response to the existential threat to the ICC’s authority posed by US authorities. However, it is intrinsic to the role of the ICC and its fight against impunity to have to preside over difficult cases, oftentimes involving little state cooperation. As such, investigatory or prosecutorial failure might prove to be more common than success. The answer is not to altogether forego investigating such cases, and in doing so abandon long-standing legal principles like complementarity. Continuing down this idealistic path might strike one as a trade-off between global standard-setting and ICC potency. However, it is preferable that the Court continues to aspire towards concrete global normative standards of justice, even if it potentially means recurring institutional failure, than to achieve standards that fall below what ought to be aspired towards in the first instance. To do the latter might well prove to be a pyrrhic victory.  [1]Situation in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Decision on the Authorisation of an Investigation) ICC-02/17 (12 April 2019).

    "title": "Privacy International: a constitutional barometer",
    "body": "2019/08/20 - In the 1960s, there was talk of a ‘Fairness Revolution’ in English judicial review. 1 One of the most pertinent cases exemplifying such a movement is Anisminic. 2 In that case, an administrative statutory body, the Foreign Compensation Commission, was given the job of deciding whether compensation should be awarded for property sequestrated as a result of the 1956 Suez crisis. This was empowered by section 4(4) of  the Foreign Compensation Act 1950,3 which provided that: ‘The determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law. ’4 On the face of the provision, there seems to be very little, if any, room for judicial maneuver: if no ‘determination’ of the Foreign Compensation Commission could be ‘called in question’ by any court, then it is difficult to see what scope might remain for judicial review. Yet, judges found their way around this seemingly exhaustive provision. Since any determination of the Commission should not be scrutinised by courts, judges would be able to do so only if it was found not to be a determination. So, the only way that they could enforce their constitutional role would be to prove that what the Commission called a ‘determination’ was not a real determination. The question consequently turned to whether the Commission actually made a determination. To answer the question, they recalled an error of law that the Commission had committed made in misconstruing the eligibility criteria that had to be met for the claimant’s compensation. More specifically, when determining that the appellant did not qualify for compensation, the majority considered that the Commission had gone outside its jurisdiction by basing its decision on an inquiry into the nature of the appellant company which the legislation did not empower it to make. 5 As such, what the Commission regarded as a ‘determination’ did not qualify as a determination for the courts – instead, they called it a ‘purported determination’, a ‘nullity’, because the Commission could not be held entitled to make procedurally unfair determinations. 6 The House of Lords concluded that the provision was not enough to oust judicial review for error of law. Fast forward 50 years, and another similar case emerges, Privacy International. 7 The issue was whether the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), a body set up to review state surveillance decisions, was itself subject to judicial review in the ordinary courts. The case concerned the legal scope of s. 68(7) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000,8 which provided that: ‘determinations, awards, orders and other decisions of the Tribunal (including decisions as to whether they have jurisdiction) shall not be subject to appeal or be liable to be questioned in any court’. 9 In particular, the question was whether this provision constituted a successful attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear challenges to the decisions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal by judicial review. In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, the case has come to be treated as an Anisminic 2. 0. 10 Yet, it is significant to remember that the Court of Appeal decision had a different view, having marked the two cases as materially different. Sales LJ found two differences. Firstly, there was a difference in the language used in the two provisions. This was because the drafter of section 67(8) had expressly referred to the possibility of the IPT making an error of law going to its jurisdiction or power to act, by the words in parentheses in that provision: ‘including decisions as to whether they have jurisdiction’. 11 Therefore, at least so far as the word ‘decision’ was concerned, it was not tenable to apply the simple distinction relied upon in Anisminic in the context of section 4(4) of the 1950 Act between a determination and a purported determination, in the sense of a determination made without jurisdiction because of an error of law. Therefore, to use the jargon of Anisminic, section 67(8) applied to purported decisions, too. Secondly, there was a difference in the context of the two cases, since the provisions applied to different bodies. By contrast with Anisminic, the tribunal of Privacy International was of a judicial nature, already exercising a supervisory jurisdiction and power of judicial review over the actions of public authorities. 12 Furthermore, the legislation authorised the Secretary of State to create a right of appeal (although that power had never been exercised). 13 Sales LJ also noted the very high quality of the IPT in terms of judicial expertise and independence,14 since to him, it was clear that Parliament’s intention in establishing the IPT and in laying down a framework for the special procedural rules which it should follow, was to set up a tribunal capable of considering claims against the intelligence services under closed conditions. The ultimate goal was to have complete assurance that there would not be disclosure of sensitive confidential information about their activities. 15 Nevertheless, there are counterpoints to both of those issues. On the first linguistic difference, an adequate response is given by Leggatt LJ, who while not formally dissenting, was ‘inclined’ to a different view. He thought that the case was governed by the reasoning in Anisminic, since the only potentially relevant difference in the wording of section 67(8) is that it contains the words in parentheses ‘(including as to whether they have jurisdiction)’. But he found it hard to see how these words could make a critical difference in the light of Anisminic. This is because the decision in Anisminic was not concerned by its scope of jurisdiction, i. e. the tribunal was not found to make an error of law, because it made an error about the scope of its jurisdiction. 16 Rather, it decided that any determination based on an error of law, whether going to the jurisdiction of the tribunal or not, was not a ‘determination’ within the meaning of the statutory provision. Therefore, the question of jurisdiction emerges as irrelevant. On the second contextual difference, we should first examine the policy justifications behind it. Sales LJ found the status of the tribunal significant, because he noted that if judicial review was to be allowed, then – and he went on to use a floodgates argument – it would be open to a claimant to allege that a decision had been made, unsupported or contradicted by evidence, requiring the reviewing court to examine all the evidence which was before the decision-making body. 17 But as David Hart QC notes, prior to the Supreme Court decision, ‘the underlying issue in the case (which is ripe for consideration in the Supreme Court) is whether the practical protections built into RIPA for the benefit of the Security Services should be regarded as overriding the skepticism which the courts have expressed about any attempt to oust their powers. ’18 And indeed, the Supreme Court found such practical considerations less important in relation to the rule of law preoccupations that emerged. After all, as Leggatt LJ pointed out, it is striking that no language so far used has been held to be sufficiently clear to oust judicial review,19 and Privacy International did not become a first. Profound constitutional concerns are embedded in both of those arguments that purport to parallel Anisminic with Privacy International, as the mirroring of the ruling of the first on the latter would lead to the re-evaluation of fundamental notions; when Privacy International reached the Supreme Court, everyone knew that the resulting judgments would constitute a useful barometer of where thinking lies at the highest judicial level on the most delicate of constitutional issues, more than ten years on from Jackson20 and two years after Miller21.  It is neither easy nor particularly productive to attempt a clear demarcation between the various constitutional concerns, but I would like to focus on statutory interpretation, parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law and the idea of a constitution. There have been numerous attempts to give a definitive answer to what statutory interpretation entails. Yet, Lady Hale in R (Black) v Secretary of State for Justice22 seems to succeed in verbalizing a well-established rule, namely that ‘the goal of all statutory interpretation is to discover the intention of the legislation’, and ‘that intention is to be gathered from the words used by Parliament, considered in the light of their context and their purpose’. 23 Returning to the case of Privacy International, what does the intent of the legislature seem to be? The words used by Parliament in the ouster clause of Privacy International are different from those of Anisminic. This difference existed for a reason, and it seems logical to infer that Parliament wanted to avoid a similar ruling with that of Anisminic, as it is clearly a more elaborate attempt to exclude judicial review. This observation is not mutually exclusive with Leggatt LJ’s attempt to establish that the language of the ouster clause of Anisminic might be different, but not materially different from that of Privacy International. But from those two views, do we conclude that Parliament did not intend ‘strongly’ enough to oust judicial review, and that is why the wording was different, but not materially different? This interpretation of the statute would lead to the maintenance of the judicial review. Or do we infer that Parliament did intend very strongly to oust judicial review, but the use of ‘jurisdiction’ did not have the same legal effect as if the term  ‘error of law’ might have been used, which would have been an even more express declaration leaving no space for maneuver. This interpretation of the statute would lead to the ousting of judicial review. The court decided that the first path was more appropriate. There was no direct address of this dilemma, but their preference became evident when they noted that the exercise is not one of ordinary statutory interpretation, as there is a common law presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the High Court: the plain words of the provision must yield to the principle that it will not protect a decision that is legally invalid. 24 It is welcome that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the strictness of the presumption against ouster, in light of the Court of Appeal ‘seeing force’ in the submission that the principle of legality is of ‘variable impact’. This presumption, though, is in effect a disguised prohibition set and enforced by the courts. Therefore, the well-established legislature-centric schema of statutory interpretation emerges as pro tanto: the court will give effect to the legislative intent as long as it is in line with the judiciary’s intent. In confirming an alternative approach to statutory construction, a challenge to parliamentary sovereignty is born, as the Supreme Court appears to be challenging the legislature’s legally unlimited law-making authority. The Supreme Court divided their decision into two parts, and the constitutional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was implicated in each strand in fundamental ways: first, in the specific context of interpreting Parliament’s legislative intention in enacting a provision which purported to immunise decisions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal from further legal challenge; and second, in relation to whether it can ever be legally possible, in general, for Parliament to enact an ouster clause of this kind. On the one hand, such speculation about this doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty could be treated as non-determinative of the scope of parliamentary legislative authority, for if Parliament truly is sovereign, this is a matter the courts do not have the authority to decide. 25 Instead, the case could be perceived as revealing in so far as it provides a clear insight into the constitutional framework within which many judges increasingly perceive their role and their ability to express ideas of legislative authority. On the other hand, what if courts are indeed trying to decide the future of parliamentary sovereignty? Recent case development would substantiate this hypothesis. As Lord Steyn notes in Jackson, ‘the judges created this principle [of parliamentary sovereignty]. If that is so, it is not unthinkable that circumstances could arise where the courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism. ’26 In Privacy International, we see judicial acceptance of the notion that there might be specific limits on Parliament’s power, which come not from EU law, as was the case in Factortame (No 2), Thoburn or Miller but from the domestic constitutional principle of the rule of law. Moving on to the rule of law concern, it should be noted that this concept was found in the nucleus of the second question to which the court turned: were there circumstances under which the courts would decline to give effect to a statutory provision which, even when interpreted in light of the ‘fundamental presumption’, did purport to wholly oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the ordinary courts? In Privacy International, it was claimed that the constitutional principle of the rule of law had certain fundamental requirements which no ouster clause, no matter how clearly expressed, could deviate from. 27 Although their Lordships did not decide on the general lawfulness of ouster clauses, Lord Carnwath sees a strong case for holding that, ‘consistently with the rule of law, binding effect cannot be given to a clause which purports wholly to exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to review a decision of an inferior court or tribunal, whether for excess or abuse of jurisdiction, or error of law’. 28 As Leggatt J put it, there is extreme reluctance to ‘attribute to Parliament an intention to achieve a result which would be so clearly inconsistent with the rule of law’,29 using language which reminds us of Lord Hope’s words in Jackson, where he claimed that ‘parliamentary sovereignty is no longer, if it ever was, absolute […] The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. ’30 The full significance of those statements, which was not part of the binding ratio, may be discovered if the day comes that Parliament passes an ouster clause extreme enough to embrace such an eventuality. Of course we should not forget that there should be a choice: we are not compelled to accept the structures being developed by the courts, which are by no means immutable or inevitable.   Or even if we accept them, it is important for them to have democratic legitimisation by political mechanisms – Acts of Parliament might be made by here-today, gone-tomorrow politicians, instead of the Burkean latent wisdom of the common law, but it is these same politicians that hold the democratic mandate. But the indisputable effect of having such legal principles developed in isolation from the political arena, over and above political (and especially democratic) principles, is that in some contexts, courts appear to gain ultimate constitutional authority, while in other contexts, parliamentary sovereignty still emerges as uncompromised. Professor Gordon attempted to capture the nature of this ‘catch-all’ constitutionalism by using the term ‘synthetic constitution’, i. e. a framework which is superficially plausible, perhaps in some ways even attractive, but equally one which we are not compelled to accept as absolute or authentic. 31 Independently of how ‘artificial’ such an approach is, this ‘synthetic constitution’ seems to be the modern constitutional settlement. As such, maybe we are moving towards a new hypothesis of constitutionalism, which transcends the labels of ‘political’ or ‘legal’ as mutually exclusive and instead, attempts to combine the two in an optimal way.

    "body": "2019/08/04 - Case note: Fearn and others v The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery [2019] EWHC 246 (Ch) The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) into domestic law under the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”) is not solely concerned with actions against the institutions of the State, otherwise categorised as “core” public authorities. 1 It also concerns what is come to known as “horizontal effect” - that private litigants may have recourse to Convention rights during their dispute by virtue of requiring the court, based on the cause of action of a claimant, to act compatibly with the Convention. 2 The content of the cause of action(s) relied on the Claimant are supported by Convention norms, instead of substituting the common law or statutory cause of action in question. Fearn and others v The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery3 provides an example of the role of courts in the context of horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act, in this case attempting to fill the gap in the common law action of tort of nuisance. This case note focuses primarily on the approach of Mann J in determining whether a claimed privacy from overlooking can be protected by the tort of nuisance. It argues that a principled and restrained judicial approach is the best in delineating the court’s role of infusing Convention norms into disputes between private parties under s. 6(3)(a) HRA 1998. Facts and summary of judgementThe flats in question were in a development adjacent to the Tate Modern art gallery. Their living areas looked directly onto a viewing gallery which was open to the visitors of the museum. The flats had winter gardens which had wall-to-ceiling windows. The gardens were used by the claimants as part of their living accommodation. Visitors using the gallery had an uninterrupted view of the living areas of the flats. The claimants alleged that they were the subject of scrutiny by many visitors of the gallery. They submitted that they had a cause of action in nuisance, and argued that they could rely on their right to privacy under Article 8 on the basis that the Defendant is a “hybrid public authority” under s. 6(3)(b) HRA 1998. 4 In arguing that the Defendants are liable in nuisance, it seeks to bridge the gap between the tort of nuisance and the acts of overlooking in question, relying on the Human Rights Act, and in particular Article 8 of the Convention. The Claimant’s submissions on the role of Article 8 in developing the tort of nuisance are twofold:5 ● Privacy is an aspect of amenity of land. Article 8 reinforces claims to privacy, and courts are now obliged to develop the law so as to give effect to that right of privacy by extending (if necessary) the law of nuisance to protect it. This is mirrored by the extension of the law of confidence to protect private information. ● The nuisance is the operation of the gallery as a viewing gallery, from which there is afforded a view into their flats which is inevitable and which visitors take advantage of, to an extent which affects the use and enjoyment of the flats because it encroaches on and invades their privacy. Having found that the Defendant is not a “hybrid public authority” under s. 6(3)(b),6 Mann J proceeded to dealt with the core issue of the case and the focus of this case note: the tort of nuisance claim as based on the right to private and family life under Article  8 ECHR. The role of the Human Rights Act in supplying Convention norms to private actions: the tort of nuisanceThe common law reaching out to the Human Rights Act and Convention normMann J began by noting that the tort of nuisance, absent statute, would probably have been capable, as a matter of principle, of protecting privacy rights, at least in a domestic home. 7 The Defendant’s concession that deliberate overlooking could give rise to nuisance accompanied by malice suggests that, given the right circumstances, a deliberate act of overlooking could amount to actionable nuisance. Having set out the contours of the common law action, Mann J then moved on to observe that, in the case if there are any doubts as to the ability of nuisance to form a cause of action in the present case, the doubt “has been removed by the Human Rights Act and Article 8,”8 which contains a right to respect for an individual’s private and family life and his come. This reinforces the relatively limited and restrained role of Convention norms when the court is adjudicating private disputes: the primary emphasis of protection of privacy horizontally remains in tort law. Convention norms articulating a right to private and family life, while accurately reflecting the position which the individual should be restored in the case of a successful nuisance action, nevertheless should only be consulted in the case of any doubts as to the nature and contours of the common law nuisance action. Mann J then moved on to note that the notion of “home” is expressly referred to in the present case, stating that “a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to much of what occurs in the home and in relation to the home itself. ”9 The notion of “home” here as employed, it is submitted, is sufficiently expansive to incorporate issues which are not covered by the common law of nuisance itself. It opens up considerations relevant to an individual’s privacy in a private place (in this place his home), and thus considerations under Article 8, which were originally excluded from consideration due to the court’s conclusion on the s. 6(3)(b) issue. At this point, Mann J relied on McKennitt v Ash [2008] to extend the tort of nuisance to cover the alleged tortious actions: that “external prying into a home would contravene the privacy protected by Article 8. It could be done by e. g. particular acts of directed and intentional overlooking, if the circumstances justified it. ”10 The cause of action resulting from an alleged act of prying does not arise under Article 8 ECHR, but by developing existing causes of action. 11 This is the correct and an appropriately restrained judicial approach to the court’s development of the common law in the HRA era. Although the courts cannot a new cause of action based on Convention rights, it is possible for it to fulfil its role of acting compatibly with the Convention by developing existing cause of actions. 12 Given the bridge between common law and HRA is bridged by McKennitt, it is worthy to examine it and its relationship with the present case. Focusing on the notion of home, Buxton LJ noted that Article 8 imposes “not merely negative but positive obligations” on the State. 13 Following so, the effect of s. 6 HRA 1998 is that in order to find a breach of confidence, it would be necessary to look into Convention jurisprudence. 14 Buxton LJ also observed that it is possible to draw an analogy between security or stability of the residence with the issue of privacy within the home; it is “intrusive and distressing for Ms McKennitt’s household minutiate to be exposed to curious eyes. ”15 The basis of a positive obligation to develop a common law cause of action based on the Convention requirements thus lies at the root of section 6. Without such connection, courts cannot simply resort to Convention rights by drawing analogies or comparisons between notions which appear to concern similar issues (e. g. “home”, “privacy” etc. ). The court’s duty to act compatibly with the Convention and subsequent inclusion of Convention norms and principles in private law tort claims, otherwise known as “indirect horizontal effect,” is reflected in its modification of common law principles to reflect the relevant fundamental right(s) an individual enjoys under the Convention. 16 Support from the Human Rights Act: enriching common law jurisprudenceMann J noted that since the enactment of the HRA 1998, the law of nuisance “ought to be and is capable of protecting privacy rights from overlooking in an appropriate case. ” If such development is not made by the courts, there would be “a gap in the protection of privacy in the home where e. g. a landowner used his/her land to spy on a neighbour unreasonably. ”17 Together with his reliance on McKennitt v Ash, it appears that the “bridge” in question that brings norms underlying the Convention and the concerns of the common law tort of nuisance is supported by two issues: (i) the notion of the “home” as expressly stated and referred to by the litigating parties in the present case, and (ii) the values and expectations associated with privacy and the concept of a “home. ” Commenting on the court’s approach to the horizontal effect of Convention rights, Phillipson observed that the courts’ approach in finding values applicable to the situation before them is an instance of identifying some broad principles that should be taken into account. This differs sharply from saying that the individual “has” rights. 18 None of the cases concerning the protection of individual privacy under tort law post-HRA 1998, from Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers to Fearn, has accepted full or direct horizontal effect of Convention rights. A private litigant is not allowed to invoke a Convention right directly against another private individual, and then asking courts to adjudicate on the merits of the Convention rights claim directly. The ultimate concern in question, as the courts’ approach demonstrates, is the substance of the common law on which, in light of the incorporation of Convention rights into domestic law under HRA 1998, the parties will be entitled to protection on. This is generally consistent with domestic courts’ previous approaches to the issue of indirect horizontal effect of Convention rights in, inter alia, Campbell and Douglas v Hello! Ltd. 19 In Douglas, it was stated that it was “no longer the case” that “Strasbourg provides no definite answer to the question of whether the Convention requires states to provide a privacy remedy against private actors. ”20 The seminal ECHR case of Von Hannover v Germany, in which the ECtHR recognised the possibility of a positive obligation on the part of the State to protect an individual’s Article 8 right,21 was cited by the Court of Appeal as a direct authority for finding a positive obligation on the part of the State to ensure that a private remedy is available for the claimants in the case of a successful action. ConclusionTate Modern is an interesting decision illustrating how the HRA shapes the development of domestic law. It shows that the Act, despite having no direct bearing on private actions, can nevertheless enter into the realm of private law via the doctrine of horizontal effect. While the full implications of the case cannot be examined in the limited space of this essay, it is nevertheless clear that the HRA does not only shape our rights as individuals against public authorities,22 but also disputes in private law.

The recent proposal by the Hong Kong Government regarding the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 (“the Bill”) has generated extensive controversy over the Bill both in terms of principle and practice. 2 The issue of extradition to the PRC for a criminal trial is further elaborated by the recent New Zealand Court of Appeal judgement in Kyung Yip Kim v Ministry of Justice of New Zealand and another [2019]. This case note analyses the New Zealand judgement in light of concerns over extradition to the PRC under the Bill, and argues that there exist legitimate and serious concerns over extradition under the Bill. It will also engage in depth with the observations and recommendations made by the Hong Kong Bar Association (“HKBA”) and the Law Society of Hong Kong (“LSHK”), and discuss two possible legal solutions to the dilemma underlying and generated by the Bill in its current form. In order to offer a sharp and defined focus on the relevant legal issues and principles, the political issues and controversies surrounding the Bill will not be discussed. Facts and Appellate HistoryMr Kim, a citizen of the Republic of Korea, is a permanent resident of New Zealand. In the present case, Chinese authorities state that in 2009, Mr Kim killed a 20-year-old woman in Shanghai; the police is said to have both forensic and circumstantial evidence linking Mr Kim to the homicide. On 25 May 2011, New Zealand received a request from the PRC seeking the extradition of Mr Kim on one count of intentional homicide; that request included an assurance that if convicted, Mr Kim would not be sentenced to death. In the ensuing years since the initial arrest in 2011, Kim has resisted surrender on, inter alia, the grounds that he will be at significant risk in the PRC for torture, extra-judicial killing or the imposition of the death penalty. He claims to have a defence to the homicide charge, but that he will not receive a fair trial if extradited because of systemic and fundamental flaws in the Chinese criminal justice system. He also argues that if convicted, he will be expected to serve a disproportionately severe sentence. A judicial review action brought by Mr Kim against the Ministry of Justice’s decision to surrender him to PRC authorities in 2015 (“the First MoJ Decision”) was successful before Mallon J,3 and the Minister was redirected to reconsider the extradition request. In particular, it was noted that the fact of Shanghai being the place of the trial should not be given much weight in determining whether to surrender Mr Kim, in light of the limited information upon which that was based. 4 Upon reconsidering the case, the Minister decided to agree to the extradition request (“the Second MoJ Decision”). Kim brought a judicial review action against the Second Decision but failed before Mallon J (“the JR Judgement”). 5 The present case note concerns the JR Judgement regarding the Second Decision. In particular, it focuses on the third and seventh grounds of appeal, which concern, respectively, the acceptance of assurances in relation to the adequacy of protection for Kim in the PRC and considerations over possible risk of departure from fair trial standards. It is because the two grounds of appeal shed light directly on the issues faced by the Bill in principle and practice. In unpacking judgement, it will also briefly discuss the fourth to sixth grounds of appeal. The JudgementA summary on material issues related to concerns over extradition to China from the New Zealand perspectiveThis section broadly thematises the JR Judgement into two issues: (i) assurance from PRC authorities in relation to torture as adequate to protect Mr Kim on return to the PRC, and (ii) possible risk of departure from fair trial standards justifying refusal of surrender. This allows the case note to shed light directly on the issues and controversies generated by the Bill (to be elaborated in the subsequent sections). Whether the Minister erred in accepting assurances in relation to torture as adequate to protect Mr Kim on return to the PRCThis mainly concerns the third ground of appeal. To begin with, the Court noted that the risk of torture is a material consideration in reflecting on the adequacy of diplomatic assurances regarding Kim’s trial in China;6 the risk of torture is a significant issue, given that “those who torture, do so outside the law…they take steps to ensure that what they do is not recorded or detected. ”7 The Minister did not receive fresh evidence in the period between the First MoJ Decision and the Second MoJ Decision to provide any firmer foundation for the Minister’s conclusion that the location of the trial reduced the risk of torture. 8 The Minister has also failed to address adequately the extent as to which the PRC criminal justice system is reliant upon confession in prosecution and conviction. 9 The fact that confession is made under formal recording and interrogation is not necessarily reliable and/or legitimate as evidence for trial, since it “does not address the risk of torture occurring when the cameras are not turned on…interrogations in the PRC are selectively recorded, and that notwithstanding rules in connection with recording interrogations, torture does take place outside video surveillance. ”10 The evidence reflects that the rule in the PRC criminal justice system that statements obtained by torture will not be admitted in evidence “is not being consistently or successfully implemented. ”11 In concluding that the Minister erred in accepting assurances in relation to torture as adequate to protect Mr Kim on return to PRC, the Court held that the Minister has failed to address adequately how the assurances could protect Mr Kim from torture when: “(a) torture is already against the law, yet persists; (b) the practice of torture in the PRC is concealed and its use can be difficult to detect in particular cases; (c) videotapping of interrogations is selective and torture often occurs outside the recorded session; (d) evidence obtained by torture is regularly admitted in court; and (e) there are substantial disincentives for anyone, especially the detained person, reporting the practice of torture. ”12 It should be noted, however, that if practices under the criminal justice system are conducted based on existing legal rules and/or principles, the Minister will be entitled to give them greater weight in determining whether to extradite Mr Kim. Under the fourth ground of appeal, the Court stated that given an imposition of the death penalty will be “monitored through trial and sentence,” the Minister was entitled to take it into account in determining the validity of the assurances offered by PRC authorities. 13 Furthermore, the different types of potential threats Mr Kim alleges himself to face needs to be considered and assessed separately. Death by organ-harvesting, as pleaded by Mr Kim under the fifth ground of appeal, is to be assessed separately from the risk of torture. 14 Whether the Minister erred in considering that there was no risk of departure from fair trial standards justifying refusal of surrenderThis mainly concerns the seventh ground of appeal. It would be useful, however, to first note the legal standard adopted by the Court in determining whether Mr Kim’s right to a fair trial would be upheld: “…whether there is a real risk of a departure from the standard such as to deprive the defendant of a key benefit of the right in question. ”15 “Real risk” refers to a risk that is real and not merely fanciful, so that it may be established by something less than a fifty-one percent probability. The Court’s consideration over the risk of departure from fair trial standards justifying refusal or surrender is subdivided into four issue: (i) the nature and operation of the PRC criminal justice system, (ii) a right to a hearing before an independent and public tribunal, (iii) a right to legal representation, and (iv) a right not to be compelled to testify or confess guilt. In relation to issue (i), the court noted that the PRC criminal justice system is “essentially inquisitorial but has incorporated an increasing number of adversarial components”;16 the Supreme People’s Procuracy17 (“SPP”) is responsible to the National People’s Congress (“NPC”) and its Standing Committee (“NPCSC”), which is a legislative body. The SPP is “the state organ for legal supervision, charged with investigating crimes committed by state functionaries…, public prosecutions and supervising the application and enforcement of the law by other legal institutions…“18 Selection of judges in the PRC criminal justice system is based on both merits and political integrity,19 and the political influence in the system “prioritises social policy objectives over individual procedural protections. The lack of independence of the judiciary is systemic…“20 As introduced above, the JR Judgement also identified three rights for the purpose of articulating and assessing the risk of departure from fair trial standards. Firstly, in relation to a right to a hearing before an independent and public tribunal, the Court noted that the system operates in a way which “enables a decision to be made by a body other than the body that heard the case. The procedural rights do not alter the fundamental structure of the system…those procedural rights are largely discretionary and…pale in comparison with the objective of maintaining stability through punishing crime. ”21Given the PRC criminal justice system is inherently subject to political control, the assurances provided “cannot reasonably be seen as providing reassurance that Mr Kim’s case will be dealt with in some different way,” and that it was not reasonably open to the Minister to “conclude, on the information before her, that the risk that Mr Kim would not be tried before an independent tribunal was addressed by these assurances. ”22 Secondly, in relation to a right to legal representation, after noting that the procedural deficiencies were not adequately addressed in practice,23 the Court stated that right for the defence to apply for disclosure of evidence held by the prosecution helpful to their case is “difficult to exercise when the defence does not know what evidence the prosecution holds and when the grant of the application for disclosure is discretionary. ”24 The position of the PRC defence bar also arguably strengthens the criticism that there is a lack of a right to a fair trial under the PRC criminal justice system, since it is not clear whether the defence bar operates in an environment which can secure defendants with the benefit of legal representation. 25 It is the norm in the PRC that “witnesses do not appear, and so will not be available for cross-examinations”;26 it is crucial to consider “how the procedural right to examine witnesses operates in practice, and whether there is in substance a right for the accused to examine witnesses. ”27 Thirdly, in relation to a right not to be compelled to testify or confess guilt, the Court notes that legal niceties in terms of lack of legal consequences flowing from refusal to answer in interrogation are “very likely to be lost sight of within the human dynamic of an interrogation, especially when they interrogation may extend on and off over a period of months. ”28 In the present case, the Minister should “require an assurance that Mr Kim has the opportunity to have a legal representative during interrogation. ”29 Analysis of the judgement and a summary of issues on the proposed BillThe JR Judgement reflects a number of important issues to consider in terms of extraditing an individual to another country to face a criminal trial. First and foremost, it is important to ensure that fundamental human rights enjoyed by the extraditees as recognised in international law30 would be safeguard once he/she is extradited, or that any legally permissible interference with such rights by the recipient State’s authorities can be justified under the relevant domestic and international legal frameworks. The pertinent issue in the present context, however, is that the PRC has not ratified the ICCPR and implements the provision which it has signed in domestic law. It would therefore be difficult for extraditees in the PRC to claim fundamental human rights protections in relation to rights against, inter alia, torture and extra-legal interrogations under the ICCPR. The risk of torture in the extradition context is problematic as it implies that once the individual is extradited, the extraditing State would lose all practical means of guaranteeing on its own initiative that the individual would not be subjected to torture of any sorts in the recipient State. The extra-legal practice of using torture to obtain evidence further exacerbates the problem, as it would be very difficult if not virtually impossible for the extraditing State to monitor the treatment of the extraditee in the recipient State. Any distinction between (i) any prohibitions against torture as stated in statutory texts and (ii) the actual practice and extent of use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence generates considerable doubts as to any assurances, regardless of its cogency in terms of use of language. In the PRC context, given that a criminal trial “relies extensively on documents, rendering a trial virtually a trial by affidavits,”31 the use of torture in obtaining confessions which are subsequently documented and presented in the actual trial poses grave concerns to the integrity of the pre-trial process of obtaining statements from the accused as a whole. Before moving on to analyse the contents and effects of the Bill in light of the JR Judgement, the nature of denial of justice resulting from improper and human rights-violating procedures should be briefly noted. Under the sixth ground of appeal on the question of the correct legal standard in determining whether Kim’s right to a fair trial will be upheld, the Court stated that the material concept is “flagrant denial of justice” with jurisprudential roots in the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”). In Othman v United Kingdom,32 the European Court of Human Rights noted that a flagrant denial of justice requires “a breach of the principles of fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article. ”33 While the JR Judgement did not adopt in full the concept as elucidated by the Othman, its suggestion that there needs to be “a real risk of a departure from the standard such as to deprive the defendant of a key benefit of the right in question”34 shows that it is crucial to ensure that any relevant right which an accused may enjoy under international law in the extraditing and/or recipient State can be preserved and manifested. The JR Judgement suggests that in the context of extradition cases, human rights guarantees and actual practices in the recipient State’s criminal justice system are the most important considerations in ensuring the integrity of any extradition regimes. From the perspective and standpoint of the extraditing State, it would thus be crucial any extradition agreements and decisions to, so far is possible, to ensure that the extraditee will be entitled to similar if not the same degrees of human rights and procedural protections as he/she can enjoy in the extraditing State if he/she is to face a criminal trial therein. It is to these twin issues, together with the particular contexts and concerns relevant to extradition to PRC, that this case note now turns to. The nature of the agreements to be made under the BillThe Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Cap. 503) (“FOO”) currently allows Hong Kong to conclude one-off surrender arrangements for the surrender of fugitive offenders with any place with which it does not already have a reciprocal agreement, to the exclusion of “any other part of the PRC” including Macau, Taiwan, and the Mainland. 35 The proposed amendment to the FOO would remove these geographical limitations and permit one-off “special surrender arrangements” to be made between Hong Kong and “any other part of the PRC”, the effect of which is that people living in Hong Kong could be removed to stand trial or serve a criminal sentence in Macau, Taiwan, and the Mainland. A further proposed amendment to the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (Cap. 525) would enable Hong Kong authorities to provide assistance in criminal matters to the PRC. The Hong Kong Government’s justification for the introduction and urgent passing of the Bill was to ensure that Mr Chan Tong-kai, a murder suspect who allegedly killed his pregnant girlfriend Miss Poon Hiu-wing while on holiday in Taiwan in February 2018, could be surrendered to stand trial in Taiwan, despite Hong Kong not having concluded an extradition treaty with Taiwan. The Bill would supposedly plug the “loopholes” in the FOO, with respect to the existing geographical limitations. 36 The role of the Chief Executive under the Bill and practical concernsThe Chief Executive (“CE”) plays a predominant role under the Bill, since (s)he decides whether or not to surrender a fugitive offender at three key junctures of the surrender process. First, upon receiving a request for surrender, the CE may issue an authority to proceed, which permits a magistrate to issue a warrant of arrest and bring the fugitive before the court of committal. 37 Second, the CE may issue a certificate to initiate a special surrender arrangement. 38 Then, assuming the fugitive is committed pursuant to an order of committal and is not discharged, the final decision to make an order for surrender lies solely with the CE, subject to the fugitive bringing a judicial review challenge. 39 The CE may refuse surrender based on the general statutory restrictions on surrender40, for instance where the offence is of a political character, or raise other discretionary grounds that are not included in the FOO, such as the fugitive’s mental or physical health. The Bill raises immediate practical concerns. It is because unlike the twenty agreements for the reciprocal surrender of fugitives to which the FOO applies which were presumably based on sovereign states negotiating agreements on equal terms, there is an asymmetrical relationship between Hong Kong and the PRC. Under the Hong Kong Basic Law, the CE is politically appointed by the Central People’s Government41 and is dually accountable to it and Hong Kong. 42 In concluding the proposed one-off agreements with the PRC, it is likely that the CE will not refuse a request for surrender from the Mainland requesting authority, that is the Supreme People’s Procuratorate. This means that the CE is unlikely to exercise his/her discretion in the surrender process, and thus, requiring the CE to issue a certificate is not an adequate safeguard against surrender to the Mainland. If the proposed one-off agreement creates a conflicting interest between the mainland and Hong Kong, it would be up to the CE’s discretion to determine which jurisdiction’s interest(s) should prevail. The role of courts under the BillConversely, Hong Kong courts play a fairly limited role in reviewing and rejecting a request for surrender: it must only consider whether the evidence produced before it would prima facie constitute a scheduled offence under the FOO, and must not examine the substantive law of the requesting jurisdiction. 43 In the proceedings for committal,44 the magistrate cannot inquire into whether the fugitive is in fact guilty of the offence. Rather, the magistrate must issue an order of committal, subject to the fugitive’s right of appeal by way of writ of habeas corpus,45 as long as all due formalities are observed by the requesting jurisdiction and the aforementioned general statutory restrictions on surrender do not apply. Pursuant to the non-inquiry principle, the magistrate also cannot consider the quality of justice that the fugitive may face in the requesting jurisdiction and whether the fugitive’s surrender would be compatible with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (“HKBORO”). Flags to highlightThe Bill raises several red flags, regarding (i) the lack of justification for its necessity, (ii) the problematic nature of the proposed one-off special surrender agreements and (iii) the ensuing human rights concerns particularly in the context of surrender to the PRC in light of Kim v Ministry of Justice. First, the need for the Bill has not been satisfactorily addressed by the Hong Kong Government. The rationale underlying the Bill is unclear, since Hong Kong has not faced any major problems with the surrender of fugitives in the last twenty years, despite not having any such arrangements with Macau, Taiwan, and the Mainland. The Hong Kong Government’s reliance on the Taiwan murder case is not at all persuasive, given that not only has Taiwan since indicated that they would not extradite Mr Chan under the one-off arrangements in the proposed Bill, but Taiwan’s Presidential Office subsequently released a statement that “[t]he Hong Kong Government’s use of a [criminal] case involving Taiwan as a pretext to legislate a bill that may violate human rights is irresponsible and lacks a sense of morality”. 46 Furthermore, as the HKBA argued in its rebuttal against the Government’s claim of the need to close the “loophole” generated by the lack of extradition agreement between Hong Kong and China, the lack of such arrangement was deliberate. The Government could not put forward any satisfactory change of circumstances in the PRC to explain the necessity of the Bill in the present moment. In light of these developments, even assuming that there is a need for the Bill, there is no convincing reason why the amendment has to be urgent and cannot instead be part of a proper consultation process. There are other alternatives that could effectively remedy the “loophole” problem presented by the Hong Kong Government regarding the Taiwan murder case: for example, s 153P of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) could be amended to include murder and manslaughter, so that Hong Kong could have extra-territorial jurisdiction over these crimes. Second, the nature of one-off special surrender arrangements raises issues which the Hong Kong Government may need to examine more closely. Countries usually prefer to conclude a formal reciprocal agreement which secures their interests on a long-term and predictable basis, rather than an ad-hoc one-off arrangement. This is because a one-off arrangement tends to arise with little or no notice, targets only one or a few persons, and lacks the protections of a reciprocal agreement. One-off arrangements are therefore the exception to the rule, and so are only made where there are legitimate reasons why a reciprocal agreement is not in place. Moreover, as evidenced in the analysis of the JR Judgment above, international extradition principles prohibit surrender if an individual will not be accorded with minimum standards of treatment in the requesting jurisdiction. This is important because once a fugitive is surrendered, it is difficult if not impossible to have redress if (s)he is treated in an unacceptable way, especially if (s)he is threatened by the irreversible harm of torture or death in the PRC, as in the case of Mr. Kim. As such, countries will not enter into reciprocal agreements with another if this could result in a breach of human rights, including the right to a fair trial and humane, decent conditions of detention in prison and the protection against torture. 47 Last but not least, considering these extradition principles regarding one-off arrangements alongside the JR Judgment above, it is at best doubtful whether people living in Hong Kong surrendered under the proposed one-off arrangements would be guaranteed a minimum standard of treatment where the PRC is the requesting jurisdiction. From the third and seventh grounds of appeal in the JR Judgment, the Court notably acknowledged that human rights abuses and torture are rampant in the PRC, and the PRC criminal justice system is both politically-motivated and compromised and lacks procedural guarantees, and so cannot guarantee the fugitive’s access to justice and a fair trial. This is especially worrying in the present climate, seeing that the Hong Kong public have repeatedly voiced their concerns on the potential for the proposed Bill to be turned into an entrenched mechanism for political persecution and to suppress freedom of speech, in light of the aforementioned fact that the PRC has signed but not ratified the ICCPR, as well as the distinction between the supposed human rights guarantees in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China48 and procedural protections in the Criminal Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of China 2012, and the actual practices of the PRC as described in the JR Judgment. Necessary but not necessarily adequate legal solutionsBefore delving into the proposed grounds of amendments and review, it should be highlighted that a full adoption of the proposals do not necessarily address the key issue (as identified in the JR Judgement under the third and seventh grounds of appeal) of discrepancy between statutory provisions guaranteeing rights related to a fair trial and the actual practice of neglecting and/or abusing the provisions to the detriment of the accused. That being said, instead of merely insisting on withdrawing the Bill, it would be useful and indeed necessary to consider possible amendments to the Bill should the Government decide to continue pushing the Bill through the Legislative Council. Law Society of Hong Kong's proposed reviews49Although a comprehensive review of Hong Kong’s extradition laws might be required which will undoubtedly take time and require extensive consultation with various stakeholders and the wider community, the LSHK recommends that additional safeguards be added to the proposed one-off special surrender arrangements, if necessary to address urgent requests to surrender fugitives. With regards to the court’s role, the LSHK submits that Hong Kong courts should have more power to oversee extradition requests. The FOO s 23 currently states that any document in support of extradition can be admitted without further proof,50 and prevents evidence which contradicts the allegations raised by the requesting jurisdiction from being adduced51 except to identify the person being brought before the court. 52 The LSHK recommends that the FOO s 23 should be amended to be in line with Part III of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap. 227), so that the defence can adduce evidence which tests the credibility of prosecution evidence. Not only would this assist the magistrate in deciding whether a prima facie case has been made out for the scheduled offence, but this would also, more importantly, ensure that the defence has the full right to be heard. Certain rights must be guaranteed to surrendered fugitives, so as to ensure the minimum standard of treatment is safeguarded. The LSHK proposes that the accused Hong Kong person should have the right to dispute and resist the extradition request. In addition, the requesting state should give an undertaking that, if the fugitive is surrendered, (s)he should have rights to proper legal representation and visitation. It should also be made clear that, in the case of the PRC, requests for surrender should not be made on spurious grounds, and certificates issued by the CE to initiate a special surrender arrangement can only be issued pursuant to a formal request made by the Supreme People’s Procuratorate. Finally, the LSHK submits that the Hong Kong Government should make extradition agreements under the Bill more transparent to the general public. One method to increase transparency would be to require the CE to clearly list out the criteria (s)he has considered in issuing the certificate, including but not limited to the offence not being of a political nature or being a civil dispute. The Hong Kong Government must also increase its efforts to enter into formal reciprocal agreements with jurisdictions presently without such agreements. An argument from the UK Human Rights Act 1998In order to ensure that a decision to extradite an individual and the decision’s execution would not be prejudicial against the rights to fair trial and against torture under the ICCPR, it is submitted that insights can be drawn from the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA 1998”). Under section 6(1) HRA 1998, it would be unlawful for a public authority to “act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right”; courts are also categorised as “public authorities” under the HRA. 53 By requiring a public authority to act compatibly with an individual’s ECHR right, the Act aims to reduce instances of questionable executive and judicial behaviour. 54 It also opens another avenue for appellate courts to review a court’s first-instance decision, by considering whether the court’s decision is compatible with its duty to act compatibly with a Convention right. In terms of the Bill’s context, it is submitted that an amendment to the Bill can consider requiring courts to act compatibly with the rights that individuals are entitled to in the extradition context under the HKBORO. Having proposed the possibility of drawing insights from the HRA section 6 context, the approach of appellate courts to reviewing first-instance decisions under the HRA should also be briefly discussed. 55 Two UK Supreme Court cases are of particular significance here. Firstly, in In re B (A Child), Lord Clarke noted that in the context of a care order under the Children Act 1989, the correct approach is to “treat the exercise as an appellate exercise and not as a fresh determination of necessity or proportionality,” and that an appellate court should not intervene “absent an error of principle. ”56 In the Bill’s context, this means that while the magistrate’s decision and judgement to extradite the suspect can be challenged on grounds of alleged incompatibility with the ICCPR, it will enjoy presumptive validity and an error of principle is necessary in order to rebut such presumption. In contrast, Lady Hale’s dissenting judgement requiring the appellate court to conduct a proportionality analysis of the first-instance judgement afresh57 is based on an appellate court’s inherent duty to act compatibly with the ECHR as a public authority under s. 6(1) HRA 1998. 58 Secondly, in R (on the application of AR) v CC of Greater Manchester Police and another, Lord Carnwath noted that the rejection of the minority view in In re B (A Child) “reflected the general policy consideration that the purpose of the appeal is to enable the reasoning of the lower court to be reviewed and errors corrected, not to provide an opportunity for the parties to reargue the same case. ”59 It is necessary for the first-instance decision to be wrong “because of an identifiable flaw in the judge’s reasoning, such as a gap in logic, a lack of consistency, or a failure to take account of some material factor, which undermines the cogency of the conclusion. ”60 The UK approach to reviewing lower courts’ first-instance decisions, considering it in the context of the Bill, would suggest that while the magistrate’s decision to extradite would enjoy presumptive validity upon appeal, an identifiable flaw in terms of legal reasoning, consideration of relevant factors and application of legal principles and facts may nevertheless give rise to a successful appeal. ConclusionExtradition laws and regimes require not only prudent consideration of the applicable and supporting legal principles underpinning the system, but also giving considerable weight to the actual practices of the recipient State. Kim v Ministry of Justice is a compelling illustration as to the necessity of guaranteeing comprehensive protection of fundamental human rights inherently enjoyed by a suspect in a criminal case. It has also shed light on the controversies over the Bill proposed by the Hong Kong Government, showing that there exists a significant number of legal and practical loopholes in terms of guaranteeing adequate human rights protection and ensuring that actual practices within the PRC criminal justice system are in conformity with the statutory prohibitions against torture. It has also summarised and analysed the observations made by the HKBA and LSHK, and highlighted two principal and pertinent grounds of amendment should the Bill be proposed again in the future. 61 While a comprehensive analysis of the JR Judgement and the issues underpinning and generated by the Bill cannot be examined in the limited space of this article, it is clear that any amendments to the Bill must not only seek to limit its applicability, but tackle more fundamental issues over human rights guarantees both in principle and practice.

    "body": "2019/03/15 - Case Note: In re Siobhan McLaughlin [2018] UKSC 481 The thorny nature of a declaration of incompatibility (“DoI”) under section 4 Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”), and its role vis-a-vis the Parliament in alerting the latter to Convention-incompatible legislations, has been of topical interest for understanding the role of the courts in the context of protection of human rights in the UK, and its role vis-a-vis Parliament in alerting the latter to Convention-incompatible legislation. It is therefore pertinent that courts adopt a principled and accessible approach in determining whether a DoI should be granted. Following that, as the courts are expected to assess the Convention compatibility of the piece(s) of legislation before them alleged to be incompatible with the Convention, it is also important that the courts adopt a consistent and principled approach under s. 2 HRA 1998. This case note analyses the Supreme Court’s decision in In re Siobhan McLaughlin,2 which sheds light on the two aforementioned sections. 3 Two arguments will be made. Firstly, examining Lady Hale’s approach to and the threshold for granting a DoI, it argues that the s. 4 approach proposed is unsatisfactory and fails to clarify the confusion generated by earlier Supreme Court cases. Secondly, analysing the different judges’ approaches to consideration of Strasbourg jurisprudence under s. 2 and their impacts on their respective decisions, the case note observes that a principled approach would be beneficial to the court’s assessment of Strasbourg jurisprudence under s. 2, which would impact on the court’s conclusion on an application for a DoI. Facts and appellate historyMs McLaughlin is a widow with four children. She was not married to her (now deceased) partner, Mr Adams, because of his personal preferences. Mr Adams had made sufficient national insurance contributions for Ms McLaughlin to be able to claim a bereavement payment and widowed parent’s allowance (“WPA”); she would be entitled to them under s. 39A of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”), had they been married. Section 39A provides that the section applies where (a) “a person whose spouse or civil partner dies on or after the appointed day is under pensionable age at the time of the spouse’s or civil partner’s death, or…(provision about a man whose wife died). ” Having her claims for bereavement payment and WPA rejected by the Northern Ireland Department for Communities, Ms McLaughlin applied for judicial review of that decision on the ground that s. 39A was incompatible with Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”), read in conjunction with either Article 8 or Article 1 of the First Protocol (“A1P1”). The claim succeeded in part before Treacy J in the High Court. The Court of Appeal held unanimously that s. 39A of the 1992 Act was compatible with the Convention. Ms McLaughlin appealed. Before the Supreme Court, the Appellant argued that the difference in treatment is largely based on the birth status of the children, which is a “suspect ground,” requiring particularly careful scrutiny. The marriage condition has the effect that (almost) all the children adversely affected are “illegitimate,”4 and all, or almost all, the children positively affected will be “legitimate. ”5 On the other hand, the Respondent submitted that the legitimate aim of the 1992 Act (including s. 39A) was to promote the institutions of marriage and civil partnership by conferring eligibility to claim only on the spouse or civil partner of the person who made the contributions. Relevant Strasbourg jurisprudenceIn Shackell v United Kingdom,6 the European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) declared inadmissible a complaint that denying widow’s benefits to unmarried surviving partners discriminated against the survivor and her children on the ground of her unmarried status and the children’s “illegitimacy. ” Relying on the Commission’s view in Lindsay v United Kingdom,7 which held that marriage is different from cohabitation, the ECtHR held that the applicant’s situation was not comparable to that of a widow, although it also went on to hold that in any event the difference in treatment was justified, and hence application inadmissible. Judgement and the court’s observations on (i) the consideration of Strasbourg jurisprudence and (ii) the approach on making a declaration of incompatibilityLady Hale's approach to sections 2 and 4 Human Rights Act 1998Distinguishing Shackell from the present case, Lady Hale noted that it cannot be regarded as “conclusively against the conclusion that for this purpose the situations are analogous. ” The court in Shackell, unlike Treacy J at first instance in the present case, did not examine the purpose of each benefit separately and ask whether they should be distinguished when it came to the justification of unmarried parents and their children. 8 Moving on to the substance and purpose of the 1992 Act, Lady Hale held that it is not a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of privileging marriage to deny the Appellant and her children the benefit of Adams’ contributions on the basis of them not being married to one another. 9 The allowance under the 1992 Act existed “because of the responsibilities of the deceased and survivor towards their children,”10 this view being “reinforced by international obligations” the United Kingdom is under. 11 Concluding that s. 39A of the 1992 Act is incompatible with Article 14 ECHR when read in conjunction with Article 8, Lady Hale noted, in an ambiguous manner and apparently leading to no obvious conclusions, that the “operation of exclusion of all unmarried couples is not necessarily incompatible. ”12 The test for incompatibility under s. 4 “is not that the legislation must operate incompatibly in all or even nearly all cases. It is enough that it will inevitably operate incompatibly in a legally significant number of cases. ”13 Lord Mance's concurrence on Strasbourg jurisprudenceAgreeing with Lady Hale’s judgement, Lord Mance also made some brief observations on Strasbourg jurisprudence in the present case. Noting that the existence of marriage was a condition of eligibility for widowed mother’s allowance in Shackell, he then proceeded to note that the reasoning in Shackell ”fails to address the clear purpose of this allowance, namely to continue to cater, however broadly, for the interest of any relevant children. ”14 This is a very clear instance of a purposive approach to the interpretation of s. 39A, and also looking into the broader objectives of the 1992 Act as a whole. Observing on the nature of the 1992 Act, Lord Mance noted that the refusal in question to partners who are neither married nor civil partners “cannot simply be regarded as a detriment to the survivor of the couple. ”15 The refusal would inevitably operate in a significant number of cases. As a preliminary observation, however, it should be noted that Shackell cannot be said to reach a contrary or totally different conclusions. The main issue, as the majority appears to strongly have in mind, is that the considerations in Shackell did not include the child. The considerations in Shackell, however, clearly included the surviving spouse - the allowance for which is also a central issue in the present case. The well-being and interest of the surviving spouse in the present case, therefore, cannot be said to exclude from the range of purpose(s) the Act may be considered to have. Lord Hodge's dissent on the applicability of Strasbourg jurisprudence (and his minority conclusion)The main thrust of Lord Hodge’s dissent focuses on the applicability of Shackell to the present case, of which it led him to the conclusion that the 1992 Act is not incompatible with the ECHR. Firstly, Lord Hodge noted that Shackell and its line of authority provide “a clear answer to a complaint based on Article 14 taken with A1P1. ”16 The ECtHR’s treatment of marriage and civil partnership as conferring a status which distinguishes them from cohabitation, while not binding on the Supreme Court,17 is a “very important component of any analysis of challenge under Article 14 taken together with Article 8…“18 Moving on to observe the characteristics of the WPA, Lord Hodge held that the reasoning of Shackell, which recognises the importance of the status of the surviving spouse, is “directly relevant and strongly supports the conclusion that the co-habiting survivor is not analogous to the Survivor who was married to or in a civil partnership with the Deceased. ”19 Although the WPA is payable only if the survivor is responsible for the care of the children who were at the date of death the responsibility of one or both spouses, “it does not follow, as the majority asserts, that the purpose of the WPA is to benefit the children. ”20 WPA replaces the lost income of the deceased and gives the survivor the opportunity not to work or work less while he/she is responsible for the children. 21 If the WPA was characterised as a benefit for the bereaved children, it might be difficult to defend the rationality of the rules stating when the WPA ceases to be payable, e. g. reaching retirement age, the surviving spouse remarrying or entering into a civil partnership with another etc. 22 The Court’s approach on the operation of a declaration of incompatibilityTwo elements appear to underpin the threshold for making a DoI: (i) “inevitably” breached; (ii) inevitable breaches in a “legally significant number” of cases. While (i) is indisputably correct, the basis for the formulation of (ii) is questionable. Firstly, given the assessment of a DoI is a matter of substance - as to whether the legislation itself as applied, is incompatible with a substantive right (or more) of the ECHR, it is unclear why it would be necessary to resort to a quantitative assessment before confirming that a requested DoI should be granted. It is difficult to read in a balance between individual human rights and utilitarian concerns (if any) in granting a DoI. The requirement of satisfying a vague quantitative threshold is inconsistent with the nature of assessment under s. 4, which is clearly a question of principle. The formulation of “legally significant number” is also questionable in terms of its consistency with the nature and purpose of the HRA itself, as it appears to suggest a tension and/or potential conflict between utilitarianism and individual human rights: as long as the incompatibility in question would not be found in a legally significant number of cases, it would not be necessary to grant a DoI. Moreover, the paragraph in Christian Institute cited by Lady Hale does not support an assessment on quantitative grounds: it only stated that a piece of legislation would not be declared incompatible with Convention rights if it is able to “capable of being operated in a way which is compatible with Convention rights. ”23 While an evaluation of the formulation of the assessment for granting a DoI as elucidated in Christian Institute is beyond the scope of this case note, it is unclear how the formulation in the case supports the quantitative approach adopted by Lady Hale. Given the HRA is conceived to “bring rights home”24 and makes Convention rights more accessible domestically, it is unclear why it would be necessary to balance the incompatibility in an individual case with other similar cases in which incompatibility may not be found. More problematically, the DoI test formulation in the present case finds no support from recent Supreme Court approaches to determining whether a DoI should be granted. Firstly, in R (T) v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Lord Wilson noted that a DoI is a declaration “only that it is capable of operating incompatibly and, almost always, that it has operated incompatibly in the case before the court. ”25 Moreover, given a DoI “does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of [the impugned legislation],”26 it is unclear why it would be necessary to impose the additional hurdle of “legally significant’ as a matter of judicial restraint in making a DoI. Secondly, Lady Hale’s formulation also does not clarify the confusion generated by Lord Kerr’s observation in Nicklinson v Ministry of Justice, who noted that courts have a “constitutional authority” to make a DoI. 27 From Nicklinson, it was not clear what is the threshold for triggering the court’s ability to issue a DoI as a matter pursuant to its constitutional authority. This obfuscates the principles on which the court is authorised to make a DoI. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the authority to issue a DoI can be coined as “constitutional” in nature. This uncertainty is based on two reasons: (i) the status of the HRA as a “constitution” is disputable, given it was passed as a piece of ordinary legislation and is possible to be subject to implied repeal;28 (ii) it is unclear how the nature of a DoI being of “constitutional” authority in nature would imply the need for a quantitative assessment of any sort, as Lady Hale believes to be necessary. This suggests a degree of inconsistency in how courts approach the requirement of and assessment on the need to make a DoI. If the statute is so important that it ought to be branded of being of “constitutional importance,” bearing in mind that it is intended to improve the accessibility of rights for every individual as rights holders, The court’s approach under section 2While not an explicit issue in the case, the difference between the majority and Lord Hodge in approaching Shackell merits attention, as it determined the judges’ respective views on the compatibility of the 1992 Act with the ECHR. 29 It is submitted that Lord Hodge’s approach should be preferred. Firstly, Lord Hodge’s observation of the similar aims of the legislation in question in Shackell and the 1992 Act reflects that both legislations share the similar purpose of providing allowances to widowed spouses. Given the strong parallel drawn in purposes, it would be confusing if the court then decides to disregard the role of Strasbourg jurisprudence in the present case. Even if Shackell and the present case may not share identical purposes, it would be too hasty for the majority to not consider the purposes in detail (and the overlap between them, if any) before deciding not to follow it. Secondly, the majority’s analysis, most clearly reflected in Lord Mance’s consideration that the 1992 Act “cannot simply be regarded as a detriment to the survivor of the couple,” fails to articulate clearly the fundamental differences between the legislation in the present case and the Shackell line of authority. Instead of noting the weight that may be given to the objective of providing allowances to widowed spouses, the majority moved on quickly to consider the impact(s) of the 1992 Act on children, whom they appeared to consider to be the more important beneficiary of the impugned legislation. This appears inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s previous approach under s. 2, which is most clearly articulated by Lord Neuberger in Manchester City Council v Pinnock - that domestic courts should follow Strasbourg jurisprudence where there is “a clear and constant line of decisions whose decisions are not inconsistent with some fundamental substantive or procedural aspect of English law, and whose reasoning does not appear to overlook or misunderstand some argument or point of principle…“30 While it is not denied that the 1992 Act may pursue more purposes than the legislation under question in Shackell, the lack of any fundamental differences between the two suggest that Shackell should have been followed. Tangential remarks: the relationship between sections 2 and 4 Human Rights Act 1998Last but not least, it is submitted that the case also sheds some light on the relationship between sections 2 and 4 HRA 1998. The difference between the majority and minority’s approach to Shackell, and subsequently their different conclusions on s. 4, boil down to a matter of characterising the impugned legislation in question. The majority, instead of considering any significant parallels between the pieces of legislation under comparison, focused heavily on the bereavement of children in the present case; the fact that they are more concerned at the domestic statute itself risks not giving appropriate and sufficient scrutiny to the weight and/or applicability of Strasbourg jurisprudence under s. 2 HRA 1998. In contrast, Lord Hodge’s more incremental approach, as analysed above, is more favourable. The case also, interestingly, suggests that there is no necessary correlation between following Strasbourg jurisprudence and making a DoI. The majority, after deciding not to apply Shackell to the present case, found an incompatibility under s. 4. In contrast, after finding Shackell to be directly applicable to the present case, Lord Hodge found no incompatibility under s. 4. There is no necessary connection between complying with Convention standards and finding an incompatibility of the impugned domestic statute. ConclusionIn re Siobhan McLaughlin reveals that domestic courts are not necessarily certain of their approaches to sections 2 and 4 HRA 1998. The lack of a principled guidance, however, may lead to legal uncertainty in terms of the applicable tests under the respective section. This not only leads to potentially detrimental effects of “bringing rights home” as a principal task of the HRA, but also obfuscating the principles underlying the consideration of Strasbourg jurisprudence and assessments in deciding whether to grant a DoI. The lack of coherent and consistent principles show that it is necessary for courts to reconsider the principles and factors influencing the assessment under sections 2 and 4 HRA 1998 respectively, in order to ensure that litigants can be certain of the courts’ approaches in determining a Convention rights claim.

The ruling was confirmed in Burden v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 38, in which the Grand Chamber at [62]-[63] agreed with Shackell that marriage conferred a special status, but that was for the purpose of holding that sisters who had lived together all their adult lives were not in an analogous situation to married couples or civil partners for the purpose of inheritance tax relief [7](1987) 9 EHRR CD 555.

Aileen Kavanagh observes that in terms of status, the Human Rights Act lacks formal supremacy as it makes no provision making it harder to repeal than any other ordinary legislation: A Kavanagh, Constitutional Review under the Human Rights Act (2009), 293. [29]On a related note, it is interesting to note that the judges discussed the applicability of Strasbourg jurisprudence without actually mentioning the use of s. 2 HRA 1998. It is submitted that the lack of reference to the HRA when considering the applicability of Strasbourg jurisprudence is suggestive of the court’s awareness to develop domestic common law jurisprudence with comparative insights from Strasbourg, instead of relying overtly on the HRA itself. This looms in a larger background, which cannot be discussed in the limited space of this case note, of the Conservative Government’s desire to repeal the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights and the court’s corresponding role and awareness of developing a domestic human rights jurisprudence regime without always having recourse to Strasbourg via  the Human Rights Act.

    "body": "2019/03/13 - Case Note: Darnley v Croydon Health Service NHS Trust [2018] UKSC 50, [2018] 3 WLR 1153 A. Introduction1Darnley v Croydon Health Service NHS Trust2 (‘Darnley’) deals with the deceptively simple trio of negligence – duty of care, breach, and causation. In recent years, some judges have conflated them in a composite assessment by over-specifying the content of duty of care. In this refreshingly succinct judgment, the Supreme Court (‘UKSC’) gave a principled analysis of the nature of these components and preferred a more systematic and compartmentalised approach. B. Brief FactsThe Appellant attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Mayday Hospital, Croydon. 3  Despite having indicated to the receptionist that he had a head injury required urgent attention, he was told of a waiting time of 4 to 5 hours. In fact, the hospital’s policy would require a nurse to attend to the Appellant within 30 minutes. 4 After waiting for 19 minutes, he decided to leave. Later, he felt increasingly unwell and was taken back to the same hospital by an ambulance. It was revealed that he suffered from a extradural haematoma with a marked midline shift. 5 The Appellant eventually suffered permanent brain damage. 6 The Appellant claimed against the Respondent for a negligence, that the reception staff gave wrong information about the time he would have to wait, and its failure to assess the Appellant for priority triage. The claim was dismissed by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal (‘CA’) dismissed the appeal (McCombe LJ dissenting), holding that none of the duty, breach, and causation requirements were met. The UKSC allowed the appeal. C. Analysisi. Incremental approach affirmedDarnley is consistent with the UKSC’s recent restatement in Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police7 (‘Robinson’), that it is unnecessary to consider the Caparo8 ‘fair, just, and reasonable’ (‘FJR’) test so long as the case falls under a pre-existing category where a duty of care could arise. Lord Lloyd-Jones did not even feel the need to review fully the existing authorities, since relying on Lord Reed’s exposition in Robinson seems to suffice. Common to both cases is a reluctance, almost distaste, for the FJR test. This reaffirms that the UKSC is honouring its promise to abandon the search of an one-size-fits-all test based on a unifying principle. With a category established in the case law, it is effectively presumed to be ‘fair, just, and reasonable’. The courts will no longer ‘re-open’ the category for scrutiny. The problem, however, is its presupposition that the previous cases are correctly decided and devoid of problems. Such presumption might deny the Courts the freedom to revisit some anomalous categories should the opportunity arise. In fact, Caparo’s ‘incremental approach’,9 which was approved by the UKSC in Darnley, is nothing novel nor commendable - the very mode of common law reasoning embraces analogy and incrementalism. Nevertheless, certainty triumphs over the search for principle here. As a matter of precedent, no case law has specifically touched upon whether a receptionist in a hospital owns a duty of care towards prospective patients. With a note of pragmatism, the Court acknowledged that not very precise factual situation will have been the subject of a reported judicial decision. The ‘previously established category’ that the Court had in mind is that ‘those who provide and run a casualty department to persons presenting themselves complaining of illness or injury and before they are treated or received into care in the hospital’s wards. ’10 This means that before resorting to the Caparo test. it is necessary to analyse the case law at a high level of conceptual abstraction. 11 But at what level of specification should it be conceptualised is not expressly dealt with. However, the Court’s finding that it is unnecessary to distinguish between medical and administrative staff is more dubious.   Lord Lloyd-Jones asserted that the receptionist is tasked with the responsibility to ‘provide accurate information as to [medical assistance]’s availability’. 12 He feels that the distinction is only relevant to the question of breach. This is going arguably too far because in ascertaining duty of care, the focus is commonlly placed on factors such as an individual’s status and expertise relatively to that of the claimant. A more convincing way of putting it is to adopt the analysis in Macaulay v Karim and Croydon Health Services NHS Trust,13 which similarly concerned misinformation given by a receptionist. Foskett J classified the events as a ‘system failure’, instead of attributing the breach to a particular individual. 14 Whilst this has the virtue of differentiating different members of staff in painstaking details, difficult questions of attribution can arise in determining which acts or omissions constitute the system failure, smacking of artificiality. In sum, the UKSC is largely reiterating the orthodoxy in applying the incremental test, while reducing the need to resort to the FJR scrutiny. ii. Eliding duty and breachTo properly understand this one has to return to the very foundation of the notion of ‘duty’. Hohfeld sees ‘duty’ and ‘right’ as jural correlatives in a relationship between two given individuals. 15 In the language of tort law, it is commonplace to describe that ‘A owed B a duty of care’. The ‘duty’ narrative at first sight focuses on the status of the individuals. Therefore we speak of solicitor-client, doctor-patient, and parent-child as ‘established categories of relationships where duty of care arises’. However, Lord Bridge sounded a note of caution in Caparo: ‘It is never sufficient simply to ask whether A owes B a duty of care. It is always necessary to determine the scope of the duty by reference to the kind of damage from which A must take care to hold B harmless. ’16 Lord Bridge requires identification of the precise harm that A is required to undertake one’s duty to prevent B from being affected. It is the extent of specification that concerns us here. In this regard, Goudkamp saw the CA judgment in Darnley as eroding of the customary divide between the duty of care and breach elements in negligence. 17 For instance, Sales LJ framed the ‘duty question’ as whether there is a duty to provide ‘precise and accurate information’ about the length of time before a patient might be seen by a triage nurse. 18 This, in the UKSC’s view, goes to the question of seriousness of breach only. 19 Conflating these two components is not an isolated mistake, but instead reflects a systematic problem ringing throughout tort law. In Sam v Atkins,20 May LJ made a particularly bold statement. He acknowledged that it is customary to examine in a compartmental manner duty of care, breach, causation and damage; but that is ‘technically wrong’ since negligence is a ‘composite’ concept. 21 In S v Gloucestershire County Council, he further opined that the duty of care question ‘necessarily subsumes the question whether the acts or omissions of the defendant caused the damage relied on’. 22 Even Lord Diplock in the seminal case of Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd23 has fallen prey to this. He framed the enquiry question in a detailed manner: whether ‘any duty of care to prevent the escape of a Borstal trainee from custody’ was owed ‘by the Home Office to persons whose property would be likely to be damaged by the tortious acts of the Borstal trainee if he escaped’. 24 This level of graphic details detracts the court from first, analysing the nature of relationship between the Home Office and the property owners in the vicinity; and second, balancing the risk and consequence of escape with the costs of prevention for the ‘breach question’. Another reason why the Court should not over-specify the duty of care element is that a varied standard can be adopted at the breach stage. Nolan, in a penetrating analysis, has argued that varying the standard is a more useful technique. 25 It may well be said that Accident &amp; Emergency departments operate in a high-pressure environment. Lord Lloyd-Jones is therefore perfectly entitled to say that this is an important factor when assessing whether there has been a negligent breach of duty. This is precisely where the law could make allowance for and depart cautiously from the stringent ‘objective’ standard. iii. Conflation with other components - causation and defenceThis wide understanding of duty of care not only bears the risk of confusion with the breach assessment, it also subsumes the discussion that should arise under causation and defence. In Darnley, the CA further conflated the duty question with that of causation. Jackson LJ held that the scope of the duty would not extend to ‘liability for the consequences of a patient walking out without telling the staff that he was about to leave’. 26 The UKSC found that no chain of causation has been broken simply because the Appellant decided to leave. It was reasonably foreseeable and was made partly on the basis of the misleading information. 27 Similarly, in Rees v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis,28 police owed the deceased a duty to take reasonable care to prevent him from committing suicide. As Nolan observed, framing the duty of care in this manner effectively subsumed causation (novus actus interveniens) and defence (volenti non fit iniuria). Similar problems are observed in the statutory context for occupiers’ liability. 29 Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 enables the court to determine whether an occupier owes a duty to a person (other than a visitor) through considering knowledge, foresight, and obviousness of danger,30 which are traditionally the language used in ascertaining the standard of care. The CA’s error in Darnley is thus only emblematic of a greater structural difficulty. iv. Public policy and social costsPublic policy arguments in negligence actions are commonplace, but the UKSC was blunt to dismiss the Respondent’s arguments on the social cost and potential expenses incurred as ‘misplaced’. 31 Typical arguments employed by public authorities in negligence claims include:    Perverse incentive and defensive behaviour: In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire,32 fear of defensive policing behaviour. Sales LJ in the CA in Darnley also alluded to this argument, expressing his fear that information will be withdrawal from the public. 33 Rejecting this, Lord Lloyd-Jones simply said that the burden of proof lies on the claimant - so long as the staff testifies as to their standard practice, sufficient safeguard would be in place. 34 The problem is that this justification surely applies with equal force to the police investigation context in Hill. In any event, A &amp; E departments and serious crime investigation are both high-pressure environment.     ‘Floodgate’ argument: Jackson LJ in the CA judgment was concerned that a fertile ground for litigation would ensue. 35 Nevertheless, Lord Lloyd-Jones did not address this claim head-on. It is perhaps the specific factual circumstances of the case that led him to believe there would not be a large amount of ensuing claims.  Overall, the Court in Darnley seems hasty in dismissing these considerations. The policy arguments are not foreign – they have been extensively rehearsed as ‘stock arguments’ and are almost becoming cliché.   It is in the interest of judicial candour that the UKSC be forthright in addressing them. In Robinson, Lord Hughes admirably acknowledged policy concerns as the ‘ultimate reason’ why no duty is imposed on the police. 36 Nevertheless, Lord Reed countered that policy should not be routinely considered when existing principles provide a clear basis. 37 By adhering to Lord Reed’s policy-minimalist approach, Darnley managed to shield itself from allegations of judicial overreach and activism. This is understandable when the policy issues were not decisive in the present case. D. ConclusionRobinson, with Darnley as its latest reaffirmation, has for now largely settled the approach towards assessing public authority’s duty of care. Ultimately, it is the ‘malleability’ of duty enquiry that generates incoherence in negligence. 38 It is plausible that such malleability was the culprit in the courts’ abandonment of the search for unifying principle, which in turn gives rise to rule-of-law concern due to its opaqueness. In sum, Darnley’s note of caution against conflating the two stages of assessment is reassuring and laudable.  [1]I am grateful to Ines Chu and Mythili Mishra for their research assistance.

    "body": "2019/03/07 - Case note: Sixtus Leung v President of the Legislative Council  HCAL 1160, 1164, 1165, 1171 &amp; 1178/20181 As a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), Hong Kong’s common law system is unique: it is not subordinate to the civil law system in PRC, but the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (“NPCSC”), as a legislative body, has the power to issue binding interpretations on the Hong Kong Basic Law (“BL”). This presents a peculiar scenario which flouts the traditional western understanding of separation of powers: a legislature is able to make binding interpretations on judicial organs. Given the recent increases in attention paid to the relationship between the Hong Kong judiciary and the Central Government,2 it is of topical interest to examine it in light of another legal controversy concerning the relationship between Hong Kong and the PRC: the “co-location” agreement  at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station (“WKS”), which saw, for the first time, PRC laws being directly applicable in Hong Kong territory. This case note analyses the judgement of Sixtus Leung v President of the Legislative Council,3 and the relationship between decisions reached by the Central Government and the Hong Kong legal system. Examining the judgement’s analysis on the status of the NPCSC Decision on approving the co-location agreement (“the Decision”) and the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Co-location) Ordinance’s4 (“the Ordinance”) consistency with the BL, it will be argue that it fails to engage comprehensively and specifically with the legal and constitutional basis of the co-location agreement. Factual and legal backgroundThe Decision was delivered on 27 December 2017. For present purposes, the material parts of the Decision are as follows (as translated by the court in the judgement):    The NPCSC is of the view that the making of an appropriate arrangement through consultation on issues relating to the establishment of a port at the West Kowloon Station and the implementation of co-location arrangement thereat by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with the relevant parties of the Mainland is a clear demonstration of the exercise of a high degree of autonomy by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with law.     The establishment of the Mainland Port Area (…) does not affect the high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with law. Out of the need to implement the co-location arrangement at WKS, it is appropriate that the Co-operation Arrangement makes provisions for the delineation of jurisdiction (including the jurisdiction of the courts).     The PRC authorities’ performance of duties and functions in accordance with PRC laws is different from the application of national laws in the entire region of Hong Kong under Article 18 of the BL.  The Ordinance formally came into force on 4 September 2018. Section 6(1) provides that, except for “reserved matters,” the Mainland Port Area (“MPA”) is to be regarded as an area lying outside Hong Kong but lying within the Mainland for the purposes of (i) application of applicable laws and (ii) delineation of jurisdiction (including the jurisdiction of courts within the area) over the MPA. Section 6(2) states that section 6(1) does not affect the administrative division of Hong Kong. Five judicial review claims were brought. In summary, they concerned the constitutionality of the Ordinance under the BL and the effect of the NPCSC decision in determining the constitutionality of the Ordinance. For the purposes of the present case note, the following principles about the legal status of PRC laws in Hong Kong and an interpretation made by the NPCSC on the BL should be noted:-    PRC laws do not apply in Hong Kong except for those listed in Annex III: Article 18(1) and (2) BL. In the present case, Chow J noted that the applicability of PRC laws in Hong Kong is “fairly limited in scope. ”5     Article 159(4) BL provides that amendments to the BL should not contravene the “established basic policies” of PRC regarding Hong Kong.     Hong Kong courts are bound by any relevant interpretation of the BL by the NPCSC, regardless of whether the provision in question falls within or outside the excluded provisions referred to in Article 158(3). 6  The JudgementChow J began by stating the common law approach to the interpretation of BL - the court’s role is to construe the language used in the text of BL in order to ascertain the legislative intent as expressed in the language. 7 It is necessary to identify the meaning borne by the language when considered in light of its context and purpose. He then noted the need to treat the BL as a “living instrument,” meeting the changing needs and circumstances of the society. 8 He also referred to the Court of Appeal’s judgement in Leung Sze Ho Albert v Bar Council of the Hong Kong Bar Association (2015), where Poon JA noted that the court gives “due regard to its historical context but is not unduly restricted by it. The court always treats the BL as a living norm, rooted in the past but intended to be responsive to contemporaneous needs and circumstances, and gives it an interpretation that truly reflects firmly held modern views in the current social and legal landscape. ”9 Legal status of the NPCSC decision under PRC laws and Hong Kong lawsIn terms of the legal status of the Decision under PRC laws, after noting that the Decision was not made pursuant to the procedure prescribed by Article 158(1), Chow J stated that “what is important is not whether it is appropriate (or inappropriate), or whether there are some other alternative methods, for the NPCSC to deal with the matter by issuing a decision, but whether the NPCSC has legal power to do so. ”10 He also observed that the Court of Final Appeal has, on more than one occasion, confirmed that power of the NPCSC to interpret the BL under Article 67(4) of the PRC Constitution referred to Article 158(1) is free-standing and not qualified in any way by Article 158(2) and (3). 11 Turning to the legal status of the Decision under Hong Kong law, the judge observed that, while the Decision might not necessarily be properly classified as made validly pursuant to Article 158(1), the Decision must “at least rank as ‘post-enactment materials’ which the Court of Final Appeal in Chong Fung Yuen did not exclude as being potentially admissible or relevant for the purpose of construing the BL where its meaning is not free from ambiguity. ” He also, noted, that such materials must be approached “cautiously. ”12 In relation to the Hong Kong courts’ power to determine the validity of the Decision under Hong Kong laws, Chow J stated that the courts have no power to determine whether the Decision is invalid under Hong Kong laws. 13 He also noted that it would be unrealistic to believe that the NPCSC will or may reach a different conclusion after consultation with the Basic Law Committee, and therefore the Decision can be used as an aid to the interpretation of the BL. 14 The consistency of the Ordinance with Basic LawChow J began by noting that the proper question to ask is “whether, upon a fair reading of the BL and having regard to its context and purpose, it is intended that the Co-location Arrangement as embodied in the Ordinance, involving the creation of a port subject to the jurisdiction and laws of the Mainland, is intended to the prohibited or excluded. ”15 He then noted that, in order to answer the question, it is necessary to have regard to the context and purpose of the BL, particularly Articles 18(1) and (2), 19(2) and 80; he identified the aforementioned provisions as having the purpose to “give effect to the ‘two systems’ part of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle. ”16 He then stated that the creation of the MPA does not appear to be inconsistent with the purpose of the BL. Observing the emphasis of the Hong Kong courts on the nature of the BL as a “living instrument,” Chow J noted that “the Basic Law should be treated as being capable of growth and development over time to meet new social, economic and political realities, and construed and applied in a manner which is responsive to contemporaneous needs and circumstances over its entire life. ” A reading of the BL as prohibiting the co-location agreement would involve a failure to recognise the BL as a living instrument. 17 He also noted that the establishment of the MPA and the customs, immigration and quarantine controls is a manifestation of the exercise of a high degree of autonomy by Hong Kong and the recognition of the two distinct and separate systems being practiced in Hong Kong and Mainland. 18 Recognising that mere expediency is not a sufficient reason to justify arrangement which is otherwise inconsistent with the BL, Chow J nevertheless noted that the arrangement is “beneficial to the overall interests of Hong Kong” is a relevant consideration when determining whether such arrangement is prohibited by the BL. 19 Analysis of judgement and broader implicationsHong Kong Basic Law and common law in the shadow of the interpretive power of the NPCSCThe interplay between the Hong Kong legal system (in particular, in the area of constitutional law) and a legislative interpretation or decision made by the NPCSC is a unique arrangement. Despite being open to possible criticisms of a collapse of the doctrine of separation of powers,20 this should not be overemphasised in light of the designated role of the NPCSC under the BL. The BL is, after all, a creation of the PRC Constitution. 21 That being said, it is unclear how “the will of the State”22 would be remotely relevant in statutory interpretation in the BL context. It may be suggested that the “will of the State” equates to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, but it would be premature to equate the two without substantiating the reasons beneath so. While they both represent the intention of the highest legislative authority of a country, the notion of “will of the State” as reflected in the present judgement focuses sharply on interpreting the BL, while Parliamentary Sovereignty is more generally understood as the legislative, not interpretive, intention of the legislature. 23 Chow J’s observation that the material consideration of the Decision under PRC laws should be “whether the NPCSC has the legal power to do so” is also problematic. It fails to justify why the significant emphasis should be on the legal power of NPCSC, and why the requirement to seek interpretation in accordance with the procedural requirements under Article 158 BL should play less weight. The fact that Chow J is only deciding on the legal status of the Decision itself and itself only would be of little avail to his defence. This is because he then supported his conclusion on the need for significant emphasis on the NPCSC’s legal power (and thus accepting the Respondent’s expert evidence) by referring to decisions of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. The decisions cited, namely Lau Kong Yung v Director of Immigration24 and Chong Fung Yuen, both only noted that the power under Article 158(1) is in “general and qualified terms. ” The court in Chong Fung Yuen has noted that this “extends to every provision of the Basic Law. ” While it is true that the NPCSC does have an unlimited and general power to interpretive the substantive provisions of the BL, the case for procedural cautions and safeguards is not fully dealt with. The fact that it is unclear whether the term “general and unqualified terms” also entails the non-necessity of any procedural requirements renders Chow J’s argumentation and analysis problematic. The actual grounds for the co-location arrangement are unclear from the BL itself. The Decision only made reference to Article 7 BL once, and it merely stated, without further elaboration, that the MPA is consistent with Article 7 BL. 25 This position is, nevertheless, not devoid of academic support. Yap and Jiang, in arguing that co-location is constitutional under the BL, stated that Article 7 can serve as the basis for the relinquishment of legal control over land. They also noted that the Constitution needs to be flexible to some degree, and remain relevant beyond those foreseeable by the drafters. The use of “ample and general language” suggests an intention of constitutional clauses to take on meaning beyond the original expected meaning. 26 While this analysis engages accurately with the “living instrument” analysis under the BL and the role of courts in interpreting the BL, it still fails to respond as to why it would authorise the government to “relinquish” control; the argument advanced only presented practical justifications, and does not provide a coherent theoretical basis. Nowhere in Article 7 suggests that the Hong Kong Government can give up control of the land and natural resources within the territory. Even if the alleged constitutional authority to set up an MPA and apply PRC laws there is said to be found under the “lease or grant” part of Article 7, it still does not explain how the Hong Kong government has authority to give up control of the territory in question. The purported “implied authority” is inconsistent with the express wording of Article 7. While Chow J is, strictly speaking, not required to examine the alleged validity of authority under Article 7, the crystal clear difficulty to reconcile the co-location arrangement and Article 7 BL demonstrates the possible effects of the binding interpretive validity of the NPCSC Decision, regardless of how unfounded it may be to a lawyer with a common law background. The judge's interpretation of  living  instrument and implications27It must first be borne in mind that Chow J’s observations from paragraph 70 onwards are very difficult to challenge on appeal, as they mainly concern findings of fact and the judge’s personal of the high-speed rail project at WKS. That being said, it does not mean it is immune from academic criticism; however, it would be inappropriate to criticise it from the Strasbourg perspective and jurisprudence on “living instrument,” as the notion as applied in Hong Kong and Strasbourg do not share similar considerations. It is submitted that, in Chow J’s judgement, the notion and view of “best interests” are not sufficiently unpacked. To begin with, Chow J’s observations that the co-location is “designed to advance the overall best interests of Hong Kong”28 appears to have conflated the co-location agreement with the high-speed rail project. It was common ground between the parties that the project would be in the economic interests of Hong Kong (the question of to what extent this is true is not the scope of the present analysis), but it is clear that the co-location agreement is not strictly necessary to achieve that effect. Moving on, the interpretation of “living instrument” is very expansive. The crystal clear legal conundrums and political divisions caused by the co-location agreement (i. e. in summary, the uncertainty of the benefits of such arrangement, if any), should have certainly weighted, or at least factored, against interpreting “living instrument” broadly. None of those were taken into account, or at least into notice, in Chow J’s analysis. Last but not least, it may be criticised that Chow J’s analysis is influenced by the fact that the co-location has been implemented and already operating on a daily basis. To declare the co-location agreement unconstitutional at this point would, obviously, be impractical. This is mainly reflected in Chow J’s considerable observations on the “overall benefit” of the co-location arrangement to Hong Kong. The deeper and more important constitutional issues underlying therein, however, appears to remain unresolved. The establishment of MPA and setting up of customs, immigration and quarantine control is also considered by Chow J as “itself a manifestation of the exercise of a high degree of autonomy by Hong Kong and the recognition of two distinct and separate systems. ”29 A few comments can be made about this observation. Firstly, the observation is confusing as the Mainland Port Area is still Hong Kong territory, although it is now governed by Mainland law. The so-called distinction drawn between the two systems is (i) unrealistic, (ii) inconsistent with the previous analysis in the sense that it is Hong Kong herself only exercising a high degree of autonomy and (iii) confusing - in the sense that it conflates the principle-based concerns of the integrity of “one country, two systems” with the practicalities of implementation. The fact that something may be comparatively expedient to do so (compared to other solutions) does not mean it should be preferred without sufficient scrutiny. Finally, a point should be made about the status of the Decision as “post-enactment materials” for the purpose of interpreting the BL. In the judgement, Chow J recognised that post-enactment materials are applicable in interpreting the BL where its meaning is not free from ambiguity. 30 The consideration of such materials, moreover, must be “approached cautiously. ”31 In the present case, however, it is not clear what and where the “ambiguity” is. It would be too quick for Chow J at paragraph 75 to proceed on the basis that it should immediately consider it as “post-enactment materials”. It turns on the following question: if the post-enactment material in question is merely endorsed without substantiating the reasons behind (adequately), should HK courts still adopt it without further analysis? If yes, this appears to defeat the very purpose of reasoning – to see arguments being substantiated sufficiently by relevant authorities. The requirement for comprehensive and watertight reasoning is particularly pertinent in the context of common law constitutional interpretation as it emphasises incremental development of reasoning, instead of reaching a conclusion based on ill-defined terms which serve ambiguous purposes. 32 The role and weight of the broader political context in constitutional interpretation also should not be ignored. 33 ConclusionSixtus Leung v President of the Legislative Council is another good example of the interaction of the relationship between the Hong Kong courts and the decisions of the NPCSC, and the roles played by the respective institutions. While Chow J’s analysis has followed comfortably with the precedents, the lack of particularity in the important areas of the judgement is regrettable. The judgement also, interestingly, potentially suggests the need for a more elaborate doctrine of “living instrument” in interpreting the BL. For the Hong Kong legal system, concise interpretation in constitutional matters is not only crucial in maintaining the rule of law, but more importantly, to delineate its relationship with decisions of the NPCSC, which, at least from a common law lawyer’s perspective, can generate questions as to whether the two systems are separated or separable.  [1]Many thanks to William Wong and Ines Chu on their insights on issues of constitutional interpretation under the Hong Kong Basic Law. Any errors or omissions remain my own. [2]This is especially notable after the 2016 Legislative Council elections, when two successful candidates were “disqualified” as a result of their failure (which were adjudged to violate the BL: Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Others v Leung Chung Hang and Yau Wai Ching HCAL 185/2016) to adhere to the rules of the oath-taking ceremony. The NPCSC has, unprecedented then, issued an interpretation of the BL in the absence of a request for interpretation from the Court of Final Appeal. [3]HCAl 1160, 1164, 1165, 1171 and 1178/2018.

[27]It should be flagged up here that the notion of “living instrument” here as applied by Hong Kong courts does not necessarily draw inspiration from Strasbourg jurisprudence. An example of the cautious approach of Hong Kong courts to Strasbourg jurisprudence can be found in ZN v Secretary of State for Justice and others CACV 41/2017, at [100]: “The present case, in my view, is a prime example where this court must approach the relevant jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights with great caution.  Whilst the European court in Rantsev emphasised that human trafficking is a global phenomenon calling for measures to combat it and that the European Convention has to be construed as a living instrument accordingly, understandably, it looked at matters from the European prospective (paras 277 to 279)…” [28](n 3) [70].

    "body": "2019/02/26 - IntroductionWhat is more exciting than a legal tirade between two of the most prominent English judges? Contractual interpretation is the bread-and-butter work of the commercial courts. Whilst it does not attract huge attention in an undergraduate contract law syllabus, its paramount importance in commercial contracting certainly deserves the ink spilled by the duo. In an annual lecture, Lord Sumption revisited the age-old debate on the proper approach to contractual interpretation. 1 This was soon greeted with fierce criticism by Lord Hoffmann in a Law Quarterly Review article. 2 I will present their arguments, and examine how successful the attempt at reconciliation has been. A little bit of historyTo understand the debate properly, one has to travel briefly back into history. Under a traditional textual analysis, the courts regarded the ‘natural and ordinary’ or ‘plain’ meaning of contractual words as almost conclusive, together with the use of dated canons of constructions. Contractual meaning is to be found within the ‘four corners’ of the document. 3 In ICS v West Bromwich BS,4 Lord Hoffmann sweepingly discarded what he called the ‘old intellectual baggage of contractual interpretation’ and reformulated them into five principles. 5 Broadly summarized, two points stand out. First, courts will seek a ‘common sense’ interpretation considering what an ordinary reasonable person would understand it to mean. Second, courts will also look at the legal, factual and regulatory surrounding circumstances of the contract in all cases, not just where there is an ambiguity. This extends to, in his own words, ‘absolutely anything’. 6 This apparent departure from the traditional common law position has gained traction, notably in Chartbrook v Persimmon Homes7 and Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank8, where an assessment of ‘business common sense’ took centre stage. The debateAs a keen supporter of a textual approach, Sumption proclaimed that ‘language, properly used, should speak for itself and it usually does’. 9 Sumption criticized Hoffmann for presuming inherent adaptability of all language. He further denounced the belittling of dictionaries and grammars as tools of interpretation. 10 The overriding theme is that judges are not necessarily well-placed to determine what commercial common sense requires. This sentiment is indeed shared by many academics, who urged courts to recognise the limits and confines of the court’s commercial experience. 11 Overall, Sumption sees the Supreme Court as withdrawing from the more advanced positions seized during the ‘Hoffmann offensive’, to a more ‘defensible’ position (i. e. more self-restrained approach to interpretation). 12 Whether this is accurate is examined later. This is soon greeted by Lord Hoffmann’s LQR article. His remarks are particularly damning - that Lord Sumption is plainly wrong in claiming that words have ‘autonomous meaning’ irrespective of the strength of background evidence. 13 Words have conventional meanings, but one can only understand what they were used to mean if one knows the context. This is a pragmatic approach that recognises the realities of judicial decision-making. It also allows judges to be intellectually honest. Such approach has the virtue of giving effect to parties’ real intention, rather than stretching and truncating it with judicial fictions of irrebuttable presumptions. 14 How could we account for the deeply divided opinions? Lord Sumption is well-known for having developed a distinctive judging style that demonstrates his remarkable judicial conservatism. 15 Conservatism here refers not to political ideology, but a conceptualization of the role of judges and the extent to which a court can interfere in parties’ dealings. It can perhaps be attributed to the fact that the commercial judges, like Lord Sumption, have taken a harder line for the sake of commercial certainty. Equity lawyers, Lord Hoffmann amongst them, are arguably relatively keener to give leeway. The two conflicting approaches are based on wholly different normative policy concerns and understanding of judicial reach that are difficult to be reconciled in a technical manner. Attempt at reconciliationIn fact, prior to this Hoffmann-Sumption debate, Lord Hodge had attempted to reconcile the two rival approaches in Wood v Capita Insurance Services,16 that ‘textualism and contextualism are not conflicting paradigms in a battle for exclusive occupation of the field of contractual interpretation’. 17 However laudable, it is of limited practical significance. First, it does not accord with the attitude in the judicial and academic community, which continues to resemble a pendulum between the paradigms. Second, and more fatally, Lord Hodge’s approach lacks intellectual honesty and does not offer any greater certainty to commercial parties. Lord Hodge, citing Lord Bingham, rejected the contention that contextualism is a new phenomenon and argued the notion that the court putting itself in the shoes of the contracting parties had a long pedigree. 18 On a text/contextualism spectrum, theapproach adopted for construing the contract varies according to the circumstances of the particular agreement. He was at pains to point out that the recent history of contractual interpretation is one of continuity rather than change. This, however, conveniently overlooks many inconsistencies between ICS and subsequent case law. The conflict was heightened by Arnold v Britton,19 endorsed by Wood despite sitting uncomfortably with it.  Arnold focuses on the natural meaning of the words and appears to take away the emphasis from the wider factual matrix. 20 There, Lord Neuberger downplayed the effect of surrounding circumstances. Business common sense should not be used to ‘undervalue’ the importance of the language, and what the parties meant is most obviously to be gleaned from the language of the provision. This exhibits a trend towards a more conservative approach to resolve the debate primarily on the basis of textual analysis,21 and reaffirms Lord Sumption’s position. Furthermore, whether Lord Hodge’s view is representative of the judicial attitude is unclear. The Hoffmann-Sumption exchange aside, his exposition was only mentioned in passing in Actavis UK v Eli Lilly22, where Lord Neuberger found those applicable principles ‘tolerably clear’. Thus, Wood’s agenda is still far from being the final word. Continued divergenceIt now seems undeniable that the pendulum has swung back to the primacy of plain language, and Sumption’s observation proves accurate. Lord Hodge’s proposition is vigorously contested by Sir Geoffrey Vos. Vos argues that there have surely been ‘sea changes’ as contractual interpretation is now confined to choosing between available meanings of the words - with little scope for judicial adjustment of the language to reflect what the objective person would think the parties have meant (save in the most exceptional circumstances). 23 However, Lord Hodge is not without his supporters. Goh argues that the proper debate is not a dichotomy between a textual or contextual analysis, but rather the extent to which the plain meaning rule should be applied. 24 However, one would accept that no bright line can be easily drawn. It is also accepted that it is inappropriate to characterise them as two distinct and discrete factors. But the mere fact that it is a sliding scale does not undermine the conceptualisation of the two concepts battling for a bigger share in the field. Moreover, the retreat is not a mere English phenomenon. New Zealand has recently in Firm PI 1 v Zurich Australian Insurance25 adopted a greater role for the plain meaning. Similarly, Singapore case law hasdemonstrated waning enthusiasm for the contextual approach. 26 However, Lord Hoffmann’s legacy in Hong Kong in Jumbo King v Faithful Properties27 continues unscathed as his contextual approach was recently endorsed. 28 These overseas battlefields signify that the debate continues to be conceptualised in polarised terms with multi-jurisdictional implications. The difficulty ultimately boils down to an irresistible urge to reformulate again and again the principles. Jackson put it most aptly, ‘every formulation of the rules or principles is coloured by the case which is then before the court. The judge has a sense of what the right answer is and tends to slant his/her general propositions towards reaching that answer. 29 This realist perspective has much to commend. Practitioners and contracting parties are now left in bewilderment after plowing through a multitude of expositions. 30 It might be said that courts are afforded considerable flexibility, but masking the actual retreat only serves to create uncertainty for businesses, not least when contractual construction is the staple for the Commercial Court. Lawyers have already been flooded by various attempts at enumerating lists of interpretative principles. It is foreseeable that, for the time being, the UKSC will refrain from further reformulation. 31 Lord Hodge’s attempt at reconciling the prior authorities, unfortunately, fails to add clarity to the law, but merely masks the reality of judicial interpretation. ConclusionAt the end of the day, Hoffmann and Sumption’s strongly-worded exchange seems to support a criticism of the optimistic Wood decision - that a palpable change in the law and deeply divided approaches has been repeatedly played down. The status quo seems to lean in favour of Sumption’s conclusion. For the sake of commercial certainty, English judges should resist the temptation of another grand reformulation of principles. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the academic debate will continue. Now, all eyes are on Lord Sumption’s Reith lectures on BBC Radio 4 this spring for another comeback.  [1]J.

    "body": "2019/02/10 - Case note: R (on the application of Conway) v Secretary of State for Justice (27 November 2018)2 The topical issue of assisted dying (“AD”) has shadowed over medical law and human rights law with numerous considerations, including the need to respect the patient’s right to family life and safeguarding the sanctity of life. 3 Since the Supreme Court’s seminal decision in R (on the application of Nicklinson) v Secretary of State of Justice,4 the spotlight is placed on the respective institutional appropriateness of the courts and Parliament in addressing AD. The recent Conway litigation (since 2017) has reignited optimism of a right for terminally ill patients to AD. However, the Supreme Court’s rejection of permission to appeal5 has unsatisfactorily extinguished the optimism. This Note analyses the Supreme Court’s approach to the contentions underlying the right to AD and its balancing exercise, arguing that it is incoherent and fails to articulate succinctly its own approach. The Note will also briefly examine the wider human rights law implications of the rejection in the medical law context. It will be argued that the Supreme Court’s rejection is an unfortunate submission to the authority of the Parliament, and fails to live up to the optimism given by Nicklinson. Factual and legal backgroundsMr Noel Conway is 67 years old and has terminal motor neurone disease. In contrast to Nicklinson, Mr Conway’s disease is a terminal illness. Mr Nicklinson’s locked-in syndrome, whilst resulting in total paralysis, does not threaten him with imminent death. Medical evidence shows that it is possible for his breathing muscles to collapse, meaning he could die at any time. He wishes in the final six months of his life to enlist the assistance of a medical professional to bring about his death. Mr Conway sought permission to appeal for judicial review to argue for a declaration of incompatibility (“DOI”)6 that the offence of assisted suicide7 disproportionately infringed his Article 8(1) ECHR right. Section 2(1) SA criminalises those persons who commit an act capable of encouraging or assisting the suicide or attempted suicide of another person, and their act was intended to encourage or assist suicide or an attempt at suicide. Since the decisions of the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights (admissibility stage), the Parliament has considered the question of a right to die for gravely ill patients. However, all three private members bill were rejected. That being said, there were intense parliamentary debates during the second reading of the Bill. 8 Appeal historyRefusing the application for judicial review, the High Court noted “the difficulty of formulating a clear and reliable criterion for who is to qualify as terminally ill under the scheme…is a factor of some relevance as indicating again the difficult legislative nature of the choices to be made in fashioning any such scheme. ” Given such lack of clarity, it is legitimate “for the legislature to seek to lay down clear and defensible standards in order to…avoid distressing and difficult disputes at the end of life and to avoid creating a slippery slope leading to incremental expansion over time of the categories of people to whom similar assistance of suicide might have to be provided. ”9 It also took note of the Parliament’s decision to maintain section 2 as it is,10 despite the Nicklinson ruling. In the Court of Appeal, the court made explicit notice of the moral and ethical issues underlying a right to AD. 11 The implications arising from Mr Conway’s scheme, including the inquisitorial role of a judge and the potential for expansion to non-terminal diseases, are “wide-ranging policy issues”12 and that the Parliament is “a far better body” for determining “conflicting, and highly contested, views within our society on the ethical and moral issues and the risks and potential consequences of a change in the law…“13 This reflects the similar concerns the Supreme Court had in Nicklinson, albeit in a different context. 14 The question posed before the Supreme Court was whether Mr Conway’s case raises an arguable point of law of general public importance which ought to be heard by the court. The court’s confusing approach to the balance between “letting someone die” and “taking active steps to bring about their death”The Supreme Court began at 6 by distinguishing between “letting someone die” and “taking active steps to bring about their death. ” It then noted the contribution of the HRA to the distinction and the debate around it: “All are agreed that the ban on assisting suicide is an interference with the right to respect for private life. ” It also correctly noted that there is no European consensus on the matter. This is reflected in the ECtHR judgement in Nicklinson v United Kingdom that contracting states are free to determine “which of the three branches of government should be responsible for taking policy and legislative decisions which fall within their margin of appreciation and it is not for this Court to involve itself in their internal institutional arrangements. ”15 Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that the ultimate question is “whether the prospects of Mr Conway succeeding in his claim…are sufficient to justify to justify our giving him permission…“16 In a somewhat surprising turn, the Supreme Court conclusion is vague and unsatisfactory without addressing the key questions it posed in the order’s foregoing paragraphs. In paragraphs [5] and [6], the Supreme Court noted that the question is whether an “arguable point of law of general public importance” is raised, the appropriateness of a “hard and fast rule”17 banning all cases of AD, and the possibility of a DOI if the said “hard and fast rule” is incompatible with the ECHR In dodging the issue raised, the Supreme Court merely concluded that “not without some reluctance, it has been concluded that…those prospects are not sufficient to justify giving permission to appeal. ”18 In light of the court’s recognition that AD raises arguable points of law,19 the court’s conclusion on the lack of sufficient prospects throws such recognition into doubt in the first place. The legal and moral conundrums surrounding AD have been well-recognised by the Parliament, domestic courts and the Strasbourg court. The clear distinction in terms of context between Nicklinson and the Conway litigation led to a sharp focus on the permissibility of AD for patients with not ordinary, but terminal illness. More disconcerting is the dissonance between the court’s wide considerations and its hasty conclusion. The considerations the court set out include: (i) the moral and practical implications of AD, (ii) the role of the HRA, (iii) the nature of “a hard and fast rule,” (iv) the interplay between courts and the Parliament, and (v) the role of courts in case of finding (on a principle-level) the inappropriateness of a hard and fast rule. 20 Despite neatly and correctly observing the relevant concerns in the AD debate (particularly in light of Nicklinson), the conclusion of a lack of prospect does not reflect the nature of the considerations mentioned. The dissonance is twofold. Firstly, it is not clear how the factors are weighed against one another in the Supreme Court’s deliberation. Some of the factors, for example (i) and (iii), are legal questions marred with significant moral considerations. 21 Others, however, are questions of constitutional law posed in response to the legal-moral consideration raised by factors (i) and (iii). The notion and meaning of “prospect” in the present case do not appear well-substantiated enough to justify the refusal of appeal. Secondly, and more seriously, it throws the standard and criteria for a successful appeal into doubt. Given the obvious general public importance of the issue, it remains unclear what factors tilted the courts towards rejecting the permission. Although the court is only required to give “brief reasons” for refusing an appeal,22 no such brief discourse of the factors was mentioned. This leaves the deliberation of the judges and reason for refusal in a mystified state. The broader implications of ConwayOn the surface, the prospects appear dim: the Nicklinson litigation (including the ECtHR decision) firmly established the role of the Parliament in deliberating and devising a framework for AD; the Conway litigation showed that even for patients with terminal illness, palliative care is the only viable option for them; the Parliament has also rejected (on three instances) private members’ bill for AD. Commenting on the Supreme Court’s decision in Nicklinson, Wicks noted that the reluctance to declare the existing law as incompatible is a “worrying new approach to the courts’ powers under the HRA. ”23 This worry, whilst potentially unrealistic back in 2014, appears a more understandable perspective in light of the Supreme Court’s rejection. Moreover, given the intense nature of the parliamentary debates on the AD Bills and topical nature of AD, it is submitted that it is institutionally appropriate for the Supreme Court to take a more active approach. By issuing a DOI under section 4 HRA, it can engage with the Parliament in an institutional dialogue on such an issue. Although the nature and usefulness of such dialogue are beyond the scope of this Note,24 such possibility should not be dismissed without detailed considerations in the first place. It should be highlighted, however, that a meaningful dialogue would at least require the Parliament to take into account the reasons underlying the DOI when it debates on any legislative amendments or enactments. The key question left by Nicklinson, and arguably unresolved by Conway, is whether the Parliament is required to have “satisfactorily addressed” the question of relaxing or modifying section 2(1) SA 1961. Although the Director of Public Prosecutions, in a new set of guidelines published as a result of the Nicklinson litigation, stated that medical practitioners will not be prosecuted if it administers palliative care ultimately leading to the patient’s death. The right to AD itself was still scarcely scratched upon. What Conway does, apart from the legal conundrums presented above, is a comprehensive framework for patients who wish to exercise a right to AD. In particular, the framework recommended very strict requirements for such right to be exercised: (i) terminal illness with less than six months to live, (ii) Informed, settled and voluntary consent given by the patient, and (iii) evidence of mental capacity. Although a sophisticated framework cannot be devised by the courts, it is nevertheless possible for Parliament to consider at least discussing a proposal of a similar kind. ConclusionThe highly contentious nature of AD logically implies that it is an issue that cannot be resoundingly settled in a short period of time. Given the topical interest Conway (and Nicklinson) have generated, it is submitted that courts and parliament should adopt a more active stance articulating the boundaries of such right. The Supreme Court’s refusal of permission to appeal, however, is an unfortunate step back for respecting the right to private and family life for terminally ill patients. It leaves them in a state of potential despair with their dignity jeopardised by the illness they have to suffer.  [1]Mr Conway’s response to the refusal.

    "title": "The illegality of Russian intervention in Syria",
    "body": "2019/02/04 - IntroductionRussian military intervention has seemingly turned what was once a contentious and indecisive civil war into a fray the Government shall inevitably win. Russian forces had conducted some 70,000 airstrikes by January 2017. 1 Nevertheless, there has been much discussion of Western intervention in Syria and little discussion of Russia’s intervention. I therefore aim to scrutinise Russian intervention in Syria. The Russian Government has aimed to bypass the general restriction to the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter through the State request exception. 2 Firstly, I shall set out the conventional international legal parameters for the use of force against another state. I shall subsequently argue that this intervention does not satisfy the requirement for a legitimate state request of use of force. I shall demonstrate that, because the Syrian Ba’ath regime is not a legitimate representative of the Syrian people, it cannot be a legitimate representative of the State. Further, I argue that, even if one were to consider the Ba’ath regime capable of requesting the use of force, the use of force in this instance is not fit for purpose. Russian intervention claims to target extremist forces, yet the targets have predominantly been moderate rebel forces. Russian intervention has become a disproportionate and extensive airstrike campaign that goes far beyond nullifying extremist forces. Finally, Russian intervention cannot be seen as legitimate given the large number of civilian casualties. Use of force outlinedArticle 2 (4) of the UN Charter sets out the general rule concerning the use of force. It prohibits the threat or use of force ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ of a state. 3 There are two orthodox exceptions to this prohibition, namely the use of force in self-defence4 and use of force authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. However, neither of these exceptions can be relevant to Russia’s intervention. More relevant to this intervention is the principle of non-intervention in purely domestic matters, including civil wars. This principle has been reaffirmed by Nicaragua. 5 Russian airstrikes in Syria which have turned the tide of the Syrian Civil War unequivocally interfere with a purely domestic matter, as well as violating the territorial integrity of the Syrian state. On the face of it, this intervention is therefore illegal. State request and the Ba’ath regime as representative of the stateAn unorthodox yet accepted exception to the prohibition on the use of force is a state’s consent to it or request of it. This can take the form of the de jure government of a nation requesting force, as they are seen as the state’s representative. 6 Traditionally however, the legitimacy of this request is ‘firmly based’ on the effective control of a government. 7 While there is some academic debate as to which criterion is more significant, both de facto and de jure control are considered when assessing the legitimacy of a request, with de facto control generally given greater weight. It is on this basis that Russia justifies its intervention; the Ba’ath regime has requested their intervention. The Ba’ath regime is the de jure Government of Syria and has de facto control over most Syrian territory. Hence, the Ba’ath regime acting as the state’s representative is relatively uncontroversial if one looks at it through the traditional lens of the state request exception. However, recent practice seems to emphasise the importance of a party’s legitimacy as well as its de jure and de facto governance. 8 By this logic, the authority to govern is reallocated to the true sovereign: the people.  In other words, ‘legitimacy’ requires some form of democratic or representative mandate. 9 Weller considers the example of the Syrian Ba’ath regime specifically, pointing out that the government formed, which abuses its own people, is the product of a sham election. 10 It is difficult to disagree with Weller, that this illegitimate government cannot be seen as a representative of the people. Given it is not a legitimate representative of its people, it therefore cannot be a legitimate representative of the State. Where however, a government’s authority can be linked to the people through, for example, free and fair elections, it has the legitimacy to request the use of force under recent international practice. This contrast between legitimate and illegitimate representativeness can be clearly seen in the Ivory Coast. Here, the former president, Gbagbo, lost in internationally overseen elections to Ouattara, yet he refused to resign. 11 Both parties requested the aid of international organisations, and UN forces chose to side with Ouattara due to his more legitimate claim to the presidency. 12 Ouattara’s ascent to power was welcomed by the UN Security Council. 13 The decisive factor was not the fact that Ouattara was the de jure President of the Ivory Coast. Rather, it was the manner in which Ouattara became President: through democratic elections. This provided him with the authority of the people. Therefore, I argue that the reverse logic applies. Specifically, despite the fact that Assad is the de jure President of Syria, his lack of a legitimate basis makes him incapable of requesting the use of force as a representative of the state. The disproportionality and inefficiency of Russian interventionMy reading of the international legal sphere is a relatively novel one however. After all, while theoretically consistent with recent state practice, a de jure government requesting the use of force has not yet been rejected on the basis that of its inability to represent its people. Therefore, for the sake of argument, I shall nevertheless examine the use of force by Russia under the assumption that international law does in fact allow the Ba’ath regime to request the use of force. Use of force against another nation must always be ‘strictly proportional’ to the purposes of this force. 14 In other words, they must effectively see out this purpose, in as minimal a manner as possible. The named purpose in this instance is the targeting and elimination of extremist forces, such as ISIL and Fathat al-Sham (previously ‘Al Nusra’). Yet, up to 90% of Russia’s airstrikesin Syria have not targeted ISIL, the largest extremist force in Syria. 15 In other words, this campaign is disproportionate in that it is inefficient and it does not actually address the issue it posits to. 16 In addition, Syria has suffered many civilian casualties as a result of Russian intervention. A deliberate or nonchalant targeting of civilians is widely rejected under international law. Slaughters and William argue that states and individuals should in fact be ‘obligated to make every effort to protect civilian lives. ’17Yet, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, as of September 2017, Russian airstrikes have in fact killed more civilians than they have ISIL soldiers. 18 It is unlikely that Russian forces have deliberately targeted civilians. Yet, they have evidently shown little regard for civilian life in the manner in which they have launched their campaign. This nonchalance is nothing short of illegitimate, demonstrating that, from any and every legal lens, Russian intervention in Syria is illegal by international standards. ConclusionI have argued that the Ba’ath regime cannot be seen as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, having no democratic basis for this authority. I have further shown that, even if one falls back to the traditional interpretation of international law in this instance, Russian intervention remains illegitimate. The wholly disproportionate manner in which this campaign has been launched, not in fact targeting extremist forces and killing thousands of civilians makes it illegal under any interpretation of law.

    "title": "Creating easements with ease: *Re Ellenborough Park* test revisited",
    "body": "2019/01/26 - Case note: Regency Villas Title Ltd v Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd [2018] UKSC 57 A. IntroductionThe law of easement, a seemingly dry and technical aspect of land law, has been rejuvenated in the recent UKSC case of Regency Villas Title Ltd v Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd. 1 Much of the confusion surrounding the law is attributed to the archaic language of the Re Ellenborough Park test. The present case turns on whether the right to the free use of sporting and recreational facilities provided in a country club may be conferred upon the owners of an adjacent timeshare complex by easements. In doing so, the Court revisited and shed new lights on the classic four-limb test. This note analyses the majority’s reasoning. While recognising its laudable objectives, it then argues that Lord Carnwath’s orthodox approach is sounder in principle and policy. B. Background factsThe case concerns Broome Park, a country estate in Canterbury that includes the ‘Mansion House’, ‘Elham House’ and neighbouring lands. In 1967, Elham House was sold and the seller retained the rest of Broome Park. Following subsequent transfers, Elham House was eventually held for the benefit of the Regency Villas Owners Club’s members. A freehold owner of Elham House, Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd, sought a declaration for the use of the facilities under an easement on the basis of a Facilities Grant. The alleged servient tenement contains a clubhouse and recreational facilities, including a golf course, swimming pool, and gardens. Before the trial judge, the Respondents successfully established the easement. They were granted an injunction restraining interference with their use of the facilities. The Court of Appeal subsequently upheld the decision. The UKSC again dismissed the appeal (Lord Briggs delivering the judgment) and affirmed the existence of such easement. C. Analysis of the majority opinionAny discussion of easement invariably starts with In re Ellenborough Park’s adoption of Dr Cheshire’s formulation on the essential conditions: i) There must be a dominant and a servient tenement; ii) The easement must accommodate the dominant tenement; iii) The dominant and servient owners must be different persons; iv) A right over land cannot amount to an easement, unless it is capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant. Since then, this framework has stood for the locus classicus. The present case turns on the scope of the second and fourth condition. The 'Accommodation' requirementLord Briggs’ discussion on the ‘accommodation’ requirement seems entirely conventional. Some general principles can be teased out. It is trite that the right must not be merely appurtenant or annexed to the dominant tenement, if the enjoyment has nothing to do with its normal use. 2 The ‘normal use’ of the dominant tenement may be residential or business in nature. 3 The Re Ellenborough Park formula focuses on benefits that pertain to the land, rooted in the Roman law doctrine of ius spatiandi. Understandably, this seeks to maintain a clear dividing line between mere rights in personam (e. g. licences) from rights in rem. Difficulties abound for recreational rights since they are invariably enjoyed for one’s own sake. They do not pertain to the beneficial use of the dominant tenement – it is nonsensical to say that the land ‘enjoys’ these entertainment facilities. Lord Briggs considers Re Ellenborough Park as dispositive on the issue that recreational use is not fatal to the recognition of a right as an easement, despite previous conflicting dicta. 4 This is not a controversial statement – the crux of the dispute falls on how far could the notion of ‘recreational use’ be stretched. Lord Briggs skillfully evaded the ‘extent’ question at this stage of analysis, but chose to address it under the fourth condition. Rights capable of forming the subject-matter of a grantThis requirement is notorious for creating uncertainties with its circular nature. One of its core facets is that the servient owner shall not be obliged to do anything beyond mere passivity. 5 The Law Commission in 2011 opined that the scope for litigation this created sufficiently outweighs its utility – abolition is overdue. 6 It is particularly difficult to delineate precisely when the right is so extensive as to ‘oust’ the servient owner from his enjoyment or control. Here, Lord Briggs was quick to dismiss the Appellant’s ouster argument by deferring to the trial judge and the CA’s factual findings. This decision breaks new ground as it broadens the scope of Ellenborough Park in three dimensions: 1. The nature and extent of the recreational and sporting facilities in Regency Villas requires more intensive management. 2. A wider group of dominant owners (timeshare owners and public members) in present in Regency Villas. 3. The cost of managing and maintaining was shared among servient owners in Regency Villas and dominant owners in Ellenborough Park respectively. In justifying the extension, Lord Briggs invoked the principle that ‘the common law should, as far as possible, accommodate itself to new types of property ownership and new ways of enjoying the use of land. ’7 This is arguably in line with the recent judicial attitude. In Coventry v Lawrence,8 a right to commit a noise nuisance could amount to an easement, despite being framed in dubious terms as ‘the right to transmit sound waves over land. ’9 However, this optimism shall not be taken too far. The majority is not oblivious to the countervailing factors. Annexation to a freehold is indeterminate in length whilst a timeshare structure is frequently set up for a limited duration. In Lord Briggs’ words, ‘the rights conferred are likely to burden the servient land long after the leisure complex in question has outlived its natural life. ’10 Furthermore, he even acknowledged that using easement as the conveyancing vehicle for recreational rights as ‘hardly ideal’ in comparison with a leasehold structure. Surprisingly, there was no attempt at all to rebut these arguments. The conclusion was abrupt as he invokes the vague notion that recreational and sporting activity is a beneficial part of modern life that the common law should support. D. Lord Carnwath's dissentA brief yet astute dissent came from the former Law Commissioner. He criticises the majority’s reasoning on several grounds. First, doctrinally, the expansion attracts weak support from authorities. The cases cited by Lord Briggs involves nothing more than access to land for the purposes of walking and enjoyment as a garden or park. These, as he rightly observed, are not comparable with the 18-hole golf course. 11 It is submitted that while they support the reasoning of Re Ellenborough Park, it would be far-fetched to say they contemplate the creation of a novel proprietary right. Secondly, he draws on the extensive burden imposed on the alleged servient owner. It involved organisation and management of the entire leisure complex, beyond mere maintenance or repair. 12 This distinction was heavily downplayed by Sir Geoffrey Vos in the Court of Appeal. A third objection is a ‘floodgate concern’. Stretched to its logical limit, the majority decision is problematic. It could theoretically be applied to cases such as those concerning free access to the rides and attractions in amusement parks, where active management and supervision are indispensable. 13 E. Broader implicationsPublic policyThe broadly framed fourth condition in Ellenborough Park conveys a policy agenda – to ensure the law of easement evolves with societal realities. However, it is already doubtful whether recognizing the ‘recreational’ value of land bears any novelty whatsoever. More fundamentally, the policy concern surely goes in two directions. Another major objective is to prevent haphazard recognitions that could permanently encumber the land by proprietary restrictions. This in turns inhibits the free alienability of land as a valuable commercial commodity. This must also be viewed in light of the lack of statutory basis for the discharge or modification of easements, contrary to that of restrictive covenants. Finally, the majority’s approach also potentially goes against the spirit of the numerus clausus principle, that rights in rem are confined to a finite subset. It might well be said that no new proprietary rights are created – but numerus clausus is not a matter of form, but substance. Creating a new category of easement without a sound statutory or precedential footing is risky. Practical implicationsThe decision would also be of interest to the conveyancing lawyers because the creation of this type of easement could impose onerous obligations on the servient owner. Importantly, it elevates the application of easements from the typical ‘backyard-garden-type’ cases to large-scale property project developments. Caution is therefore advised in drafting the grant documents. Lord Briggs stressed the importance of the following. First, where common intention to confer an easement is manifested, the ‘validation principle’ is applied to give it proper effect. 14 Secondly, whether the grant was intended to be a single comprehensive right to use facilities as they evolved, or if it is fixed in time. 15 Thirdly, the presence of express requirement for contribution to the operational costs. 16 This is particularly so in this case since the construction of the grant was influential and confidence-boosting in the majority’s decision in creating a new type of easement. Overall, this seemingly technical case encompasses a debate on conflicting policy paradigms. It also epitomizes the confusion arising from the anachronistic formulation of a test that provides scope for disorganized expansion. The sweeping reforms proposed by the Law Commission merit reconsideration to put the law back on principled track.  [1][2018] UKSC 57. [2]ibid [40]. [3]ibid [40]-[41]. [4]ibid [48]. [5]ibid [58].

    "body": "2019/01/21 - – Case note: Case C-621/18 Wightman v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Since the Supreme Court’s (“SC”) landmark judgement in R (on the application of Gina Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union,1 the legal position and powers of the Westminster Parliament have been at the epicentre of the Brexit legal conundrum. The recent preliminary ruling given by the European Court of Wightman v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union2 has added an extra layer of complexity to it by holding that te Parliament can unilaterally revoke the notification to withdraw from the European Union (“EU”) under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (“TEU”). Agreeing with Advocate General Sánchez-Bordona’s (“AG”) opinion,3 the ECJ held that certain constitutional requirements have to be satisfied for a member state to revoke the notification unilaterally. This Note analyses the AG’s opinion and ECJ’s judgement, suggesting that it is a prudent manifestation of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. It will also briefly examine the constitutional implications of the judgement on the Brexit process in terms of any requirements for revocation. It will be argued that Wightman offers, in line with Miller, a second opportunity to shape and influence the Brexit process. Advocate-General’s opinion and the European Court of Justice’s rulingTo begin with, the AG recognised that the right of a State to be no longer bound (withdrawal or denunciation) by a treaty is “a manifestation of that State’s sovereignty. ”4 By corollary of principle, the unilateral nature of withdrawal is “conducive to the possibility of unilaterally revoking the notification of that decision;” unilateral revocation is also “a manifestation of the sovereignty of the departing Member State. ”5 The intention of the sovereign state is, however, “not definitive and may change. ”6 Any claims of such change, and therefore any revocation of the notification of withdrawal, must be expressed “in accordance with… [the sovereign state’s] constitutional requirements. ”7 This may be manifested in, for example, “a political change that gives rise to a change in the will of the departing State…“8 This shows that the credibility of the notification of withdrawal is heavily dependent on its constitutional basis. Once any intervening political intervention undermines the credibility of the original notification, the parliamentary intention is also expected to change in order to reflect the latest public opinions. The AG further strengthened the case for revocability when interpreting Article teleologically. He recognised that Article 50(1) is not a “fossilised concept,” and it respects “the national identities of the member states. ”9 It also allows “a change in the sovereign will of the Member State…in order to halt a process of withdrawal from the EU which the Member State has decided to reverse. ”10 When the public opinions and parliamentary intentions within the Member State do not evince a clear position, the doctrine of favour socieatias may be considered as a key element in reaching a solution which is the “most consonant with the survival…of the Union. ”11 This is largely in line with the TEU’s objective of achieving “an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe. ”12 This is a careful delineation of the position of the EU regarding political uncertainty in a Member State, as a teleological interpretation of Article 50 was not considered as strictly necessary and should only be considered if the Government cannot advance a credible stance in favour of withdrawal. Furthermore, it should be noted that the fundamental rights enjoyed by nationals of the departing Member State as EU citizens also play a significant role in favouring a teleological interpretation of Article 50 - that revocation is possible unless the Member State’s intention of departure is crystal clear. This reflects the majority of Miller in stating that any frustration of citizens’ rights as an EU citizen can only be done by parliamentary legislation. The ECJ’s ruling is generally consistent with the AG”s opinion, emphasising the special status of the TEU and the constitutional character of the EU. 13 The ECJ also explored the constitutional requirements of withdrawal. In the following sections, the ECJ’s judgement and its implications will be analysed. It will be argued that the judgement represents prudent respect for parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom, and successfully protects the integrity of Article 50, despite any possible doubts over a teleological approach to interpreting it. Analysis of the European Court of Justice’s judgementThe question posed to the ECJ was “where, in accordance with Article 50 [TEU], a Member State has notified by the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, does EU law permit that notice to be revoked unilaterally by the notifying Member State; and if so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the Member State remaining within the European Union?” Interpretation of EU law (in particular, Article 50)The ECJ stated that when interpreting a provision of EU law, account should be taken “not only of its wording and the objectives it pursues, but also of its context and the provisions…as a whole. ”14 From the outset, it is clear that the court is not limiting itself to the meaning of Article 50 itself, but adopting a teleological approach in attempting to unpack the meaning of the provisions in question. The emphasis on the need to consider the constitutional structure and purpose of the EU as a whole15 reflect what Eeckhout and Frantziou noted a “constitutionalist approach,” which is an opportunity to “affirm that the structures [of EU] have come to constitute a new mode of post-State organisation, premised on cooperation, genuine respect for common values and fundamental rights, and a supranational citizenship. ”16 The revocability of the notification of withdrawal is thus not only a question surrounding the Parliament’s political will, but also the need to maintain the integrity and pursuit of objectives of the EU. Whilst a teleological approach may be criticised as giving excessive weight to the objective of European integration in the status of Article 50, it is submitted that such approach is justified as Article 50 is a key component in shaping the composition of EU membership under the TEU. To adopt a literal interpretation of Article 50 would ignore the political realities which public law responds to. The intention of a departing Member State and the associated rights stripping implicationsHaving firmly established a teleological approach as its basis of approaching the question, the ECJ agreed with the AG’s opinion that the intention of a departing Member State is “neither definitive nor irrevocable. ”17 Moreover, it was noted that the two objectives pursued by Article 50 are (i) “enshrining the sovereign right of a Member  State to withdraw from the EU” and (ii) “establishing a procedure to enable such a withdrawal to take place in an orderly fashion. ”18 At this point, it is clear that Article 50 is not merely a matter of facilitating an expedient exit for a departing Member State, but more importantly, to respect the voluntary and flexible will of it. The sovereign will of the departing State is the most significant player in the Article 50 process. Given the absence of expression provision in EU law governing the revocation of notification to withdraw, the revocation should be “subject to the rules laid down in Article 50(1) TEU for the withdrawal itself…it may be decided upon unilaterally, in accordance with the constitutional requirements of the State concerned. ” Revocation is, in essence, a “sovereign decision” by the State to retain its status as a Member State of the EU; the status is neither suspended nor altered by that notification. 19 The ECJ then moved to consider implications of withdrawal. The decision to withdraw is “liable to have a considerable impact on the rights of all Union citizens, including, inter alia, their right for free movement, as regards both nationals of the Member State concerned…“20 Forcing a Member State to leave after it has triggered the Article 50 process, despite a wish to remain “as expressed through its democratic process in accordance with its constitutional requirements,” would be “inconsistent with the [TEU’s] purpose of creating an ever closer union…“21 The intention of the Parliament will always have the final say in determining whether United Kingdom shall remain a Member State of the EU. This also reflects the origins and intention of Article 50, which in its final draft upheld “the voluntary and unilateral nature of the withdrawal decision. ”22 Constitutional requirementsBuilding on the AG’s recognition that any revocation must respect “national constitutional requirements,”23 the ECJ noted that any revocation must be made in an “unequivocal and unconditional manner…. after the Member State concerned has taken the revocation decision in accordance with its constitutional requirements. ”24 In the United Kingdom, given the judgement in Miller, this would suggest that the “constitutional requirement” in question would be passing primary legislation in the House of Commons revoking the notification of withdrawal as made under the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. Noting that the sovereign State holds the final decision to revoke the notification to withdraw, the ECJ also correctly noted that any requirement of unanimous approval by the European Council would “transform a unilateral sovereign right into a conditional right subject to an approval procedure. ”25 This also, prudently, confers the maximum respect for the Member State in deciding on revocation. Whilst revocation has to be made in accordance with its constitutional requirements and must be made in an “unequivocal and unconditional manner” (presumably meaning that the revocation should reflect popular will), it is the sovereign State alone that can construct the validity and credibility of the revocation. The European Council would have no democratic legitimacy in deciding on the revocation decision. Implications of the Court’s judgement: the relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom and parliamentary sovereigntyThe unique status of this preliminary ruling is that it is also a matter of political importance and urgency. Whilst constitutional law litigation (especially in the field of human rights) may be seen as predominantly a matter of upholding principles and values, it is clear that the preliminary ruling is primarily aimed at providing an alternative gateway for the Government out of the Brexit conundrum. As the AG accurately noted, the Wightman litigation is “not merely a jurisprudential issue,”26 and the legal consequences of Brexit are drawing “inexorably closer. ”27 Parliament’s position as delineated under Article 5First and foremost, the judgement affirms the centrality of Article 50 in all questions regarding the notification of withdrawal and its revocation. As the Article concerns the structure and composition of the EU itself, any interpretation would “affect the Union’s very identity as a constitutional order committed to the values laid down in Article 2 TEU. ”28 The constitutionalist reading adopted by the court reflects a cardinal principle underpinning the relationship between the EU and its Member States: the division of competence. 29 The judgement resoundingly puts the competence to decide on revocation firmly in the hands of the Parliament. The Parliament is and will always be in control of the Brexit process in terms of the continuation of negotiations and any decision to revoke its withdrawal notification. The judgement also reflects the overarching necessity to respect the Member State’’s constitutional process. Following Eeckhout and Frantziou’s analysis of a “constitutionalist reading,” the judgement affords prudent respect to the United Kingdom’s uncodified constitution as “a form of constitutional organisation inherently susceptible to change through politics. ”30 Moreover, one must not ignore the distinction between the decision to withdraw (Article 50(1)) and the notification of the decision (Article 50(2)). It would be unrealistic to draw any formalistic distinction between them31 as a change in political realities (e. g. a shift of popular will under Article 50(1) to remain in the EU) would necessarily, as analysed above, undermine the credibility and legitimacy of the notification to withdraw (Article 50(2)). The validity of such change can, however, only be expressed by the Parliament in an unequivocal and unconditional manner. The constitutional requirements of Article 50: a symmetry with Miller?Under section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”), the House of Commons must approve a withdrawal agreement before the agreement can be considered as ratified. This provides for the implementation of the intention to leave the EU. 32 Nowhere it is suggested that the Parliament’s intention before ratifying any withdrawal agreement must be fixed. Following the ECJ’s reasoning, a corollary of the Member State’s sovereign right to submit the notification to withdraw would be its sovereign right to revoke the notification. In terms of substance, the revocation decision has to be made in accordance with its constitutional requirements. 33 Given the 2018 Act provides for the implementation to withdraw, revoking the notification as submitted under Article 50 would necessarily strip the Members of Parliament off their rights to implement the withdrawal decision. To revoke using prerogative power, however, would render both the withdrawal agreement and any future framework between the EU and UK otiose. 34 This is because the Parliament will no longer be able to approve such instruments, once agreed. In both the AG’s opinion and the ECJ’s ruling, it is clear that the relationship between the criteria for triggering and revoking Article 50 is reciprocal: both triggering and revoking Article 50 must conform to the constitutional requirements of the Member State in question - in this case, the constitutional requirements of UK itself. At this point, the shadow of Miller flickers before us: the royal prerogative may not be exercised in a way that frustrates the intention of the Parliament as expressed in a statute. 35 The Prime Minister would not be able to use the prerogative in a way that frustrates the Parliament’s intention of implementing the decision to withdraw from the EU, as evinced by the EUWA 2018. Last but not the least, Phillipson and Young suggested that given the ECJ’s emphasis on reciprocity and the need to ensure the democratic legitimacy of revocation, the insertion of an option for a referendum under section 13 of EUWA 2018 would not be sufficient. This is an accurate observation of the essence of the Miller judgement, as the provision of a referendum option does not entail sufficient credibility for revocation. Even if a second referendum opted for remaining in the EU, the lack of fresh legislation would mean that, based on Miller, the “constitutional requirements” for revoking the notification would not be satisfied, and thus any attempt to revoke the notification via non-legislative means would be unconstitutional. ConclusionThe Wightman preliminary ruling authoritatively confirms that the power to revoke the notification of withdrawal is vested solely in the hands of the Parliament. Forming a conclusive symmetry with Miller, it supplied a clear direction and the respective constitutional requirements for the Government to consider if it considers revocation should become a real option. The manifestation of parliamentary sovereignty shows at, at the end of the day, the status of the UK as a Member State of the EU is not affected - it still has full competence to decide whether to continue the negotiations or revoke its notification of withdrawal. The teleological approach to interpreting Article 50 has also provided a clear and definitive guide in approaching the question of withdrawing from the EU: the status of the UK as a Member State of the EU contributes to the composition of the EU constitutional structure, insofar as it has not left the EU yet. Ultimately, the decision to stay as a Member State of the EU or leave it, under the Article 50 framework, is a matter for and only for the Parliament to decide: a manifestation of parliamentary sovereignty.

    "body": "2018/12/10 - Case note: Y v An NHS Trust and others [2018] UKSC 461 The question over the necessity of obtaining court order for terminating clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (“CANH”) for patients with minimal prospects of recovery reflects  two competing  concerns: (i) the right to respect the private and family life of the patient and his/her family,2 and (ii) the necessity to ensure that the decision to terminate life support is one which is thoroughly considered by all relevant stakeholders. The Supreme Court decision in Y v An NHS Trust and others3 has provided an insightful analysis of the non-necessity of obtaining a court order and the logic behind this. This note will analyse the decision from a human rights perspective on two levels. Firstly, it will examine Lady Black’s observations on English and Strasbourg jurisprudence. Secondly, it will examine the decision’s broader impact on the law’s respect for the concerns of the patient and family’s decisions in treatment withdrawal decisions, and the doctor’s role therein. It will come to the conclusion that the commendable decision has offered a desirable degree of autonomy for patients and their families  in making decisions to terminate medical treatment. Facts and appellate historyThe patient, Mr Y, had a prolonged disorder of consciousness (“PDOC”). Medical  examinations suggest that he was unlikely to regain consciousness. He had neither executed any advance refusals nor appointed a lasting power of attorney under section 9 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (“MCA 2005”). The clinical team and Y’s family agreed that it would be in his best interests for CANH to be withdrawn, with the consequence that he would die within a period of two to three weeks. At first instance, O’Farrell J held that “it is not mandatory to bring before the court the withdrawal of CANH…in circumstances where the clinical team and Mr Y’s family have agreed that it is not in his best interests that he continues to receive that treatment. ”4 Mr Y died on 22 December 2017. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court decided to hear the leapfrog appeal because of the general importance of the issues raised. It held that there is no legal requirement for parties to go to court in circumstances where the patient’s family and the clinical team agreed that it would be in the patient’s best interests to terminate CANH treatments. Neither the common law nor the ECHR gives rise to such mandatory requirements. 5 Lady Black’s observations of (i) English jurisprudence and (ii) the ECtHR’s stance English jurisprudenceThe pertinent issue to consider here is how the legal requirement engages a patient’s Article 6 rights. By making court hearings a mandatory requirement, it is arguable that such hearing allows the patient to have a final chance of defence in relation to the proposed termination of treatment. However, for unconsciousness patients, it is questionable whether such defence is necessary or helpful if the patient’s family and the clinical team are of the same opinion that any continuation of treatment would not be in his best interests. Lady Black correctly observed6 that previous landmark decisions of Airedale NHS Trust v Bland,7 In re F (Medical Patient: Sterilisation)8 and R (Burke) v General Medical Council9 did not lay down any common law requirements for doctors, upon agreement with family members, to obtain a court declaration before CANH can be terminated. Seeking declaration was merely “recommended” “as a matter of good practice. ”10 While the illness concerned in the present case (PDOC) is different from the aforementioned cases,11 the final outcome is similar: withdrawal of treatment according to the patient’s best interests. When the patient has lost consciousness, it would yield no practical results (not to mention benefits)  to require a court hearing, when the available opinions suggest that the termination would be in his best interests. For patients who have lost consciousness at least, the argument of engagement of Article 6 is at best artificial. Lady Black aptly dismisses it. The implementation of the MCA 2005 and its Code of Practice aims to ensure that decisions to terminate treatment will be made in the patient’s best interests. Confusingly, the Code states that the court “has to make” or “must be asked to make” a decision about withdrawing treatment for a patient in PVS. 12 In clarifying the law post-MCA 2005, Lady Black stated the Code “in…plainly attempting to convey what the cases have so far decided, cannot extend the duty of the medical team beyond what the cases do in fact decide is incumbent upon them…. ”13 This is consistent with previous decisions holding that there is no common law requirement for medical teams to apply for the court for a formal declaration. It also illustrates the law’s appropriately permissive approach in cases where the best interests of the patient are not contested between the medical team and the patient. Given the court’s role as a last resort for parties to plead a case in favour of continuing medical treatment, if the views on best interests point unanimously towards termination of treatment, no question of erosion of the right to life arise. Strasbourg jurisprudenceAfter observing that domestic law does not impose any legal requirements for making an application, Lady Black turned to ECHR jurisprudence. She began with Lambert v France and the relevant French regulatory framework. Elaborating on ECtHR’s stance on the non-necessity of mandatory legal requirements together with the aforementioned observations, she concluded the English provisions under MCA 2005 and its Code is a “regulatory framework” as required by the European Court. They were designed to “protect the human rights of patients and their families. ”14 The Lambert decision, arguably the most important Strasbourg decision in this respect, “does not regard it as problematic…that a decision to withhold or withdraw CANH…should be made by a doctor, without obligatory court involvement. ”15 Lady Black identified three features in the European Court’s assessment: “the existence in domestic law and practice of a regulatory framework compatible with the requirements of Article 2,”16 “whether account has been taking of the previously expressed wishes and those of people close to him, as well as the opinions of other medical personnel,”17 and “the possibility of approaching the courts in the vent of doubts as to the best decision to take in the patient’s interest. ”18 Of particular relevance to the present analysis is the final factor. Lady Black placed reliance in the ECtHR’s observation in the adminissibility decision in Burke v United Kingdom [19] that a “more stringent legal duty” would be “prescriptively burdensome” for the parties involved. Apart from considerations of principle, the practical aspects of such court involvement cannot be neglected in passing. It is interesting to note that the ECHR’s focus is on a possibility to approach, instead of a requirement to approach. So long as it is possible for parties to seek judicial assistance, it is not necessary to impose any further requirements. This is not only a question of epistemology. It is, more importantly, a crucial finesse of the State’s role in protecting people’s right to life and fair trial, whilst simultaneously offering the possible maximum respect for the clinical team’s expertise and the grieving families. Although Article 2 is an absolute (non-derogable) right, this does not mean the State should be required to interpret expansively such requirement and impose unnecessary restraints on treatment decisions, which better reflects the best interests of the patient. Reflections on the decision’s impact: a full respect for patient and family’s human rights?In examining the nature of court involvement, Lady Black noted that it is “necessary to exercise the restraint that is required of a court when it ventures into areas of social and ethical uncertainty, and especially when it does so in the abstract, setting out views which will be of general application…“20 While judges have experience in adjudicating life and death decisions, it is “a different sort from that of the medical team which actually treats the patient…this limitation must be recognised and taken into account. ”21 Judges are not necessarily always in the best position to adjudicate on clinical decisions and the best interests of the patient. The obligation of the State to secure the patient’s right to life cannot reasonably be seen as an omnipotent requirement to intervene in the private affairs of the family. Given the unique insights the clinical team has pertaining to patient care, courts should limit their involvement to a reasonable minimum. In examining the patient’s best interests, doctors must follow the guidelines as set out under section 4 MCA 2005. 22 It is a holistic judgement, which, inter alia, requires consideration of the patient’s values and family members concerned of the patient’s welfare. 23 In extending considerations to family members, it can also be said that the right to private and family life for grieving family members can be better respected. Determinations over best interests must necessarily have regard to the views of family members. When the clinical team have reached the proposal of terminating treatment (e. g. CANH) after a comprehensive examination of the patient’s best interests, it would be unnecessary to force them to go to court again to obtain a declaratory relief to which they would agree to regardless whether court process is involved. Moreover, declaratory relief may carry potential emotional burdens for families. For some relatives, the prospect of declaratory relief may be distressing because they feel that the court is an illegitimate forum for such decisions to be made. The requirement to go to court may also be seen as an unwelcome legal intrusion into the family’s domain. 24 The general purpose of medical treatment is to allow patients to recover. If the patient has minimal or zero prospects of recovery, regardless of the type of treatment administered, it would not be of any practical benefit of it to prolong his suffering. Lady Black noted that “if, at the end of the medical process, it is apparent that the way forward is finely balanced…or a lack of agreement to a proposed course of action from those with an interest in the patient’s welfare, a court application can and should be made. ”25 This neatly sums up the court’s role in questions of terminating medical treatment: it should only intervene when disputes arise. If an agreement is reached between grieving family members and the medical team, the court should accordingly defer to the views of the medical team and respect the private spheres of family life. ConclusionIn questions of withholding and withdrawing medical treatments, courts act as a last-resort platform for resolving disputes between family members and the medical team. The sensitivity of such matters, together with the expertise of the medical team, makes it unnecessary for courts to examine every single decision before the medical team can proceed. By confirming the court’s limited role in such medical decisions, Y v An NHS Trust provides a commendable and resounding confirmation in the law’s respect for the private spheres and human rights concerns for the patient and his family members.

    "title": "English Choice of Law in Contract Under the Rome I Regime: Is Flexibility Giving Way to Predictability?",
    "body": "2018/10/16 - The Rome I Regulation (593/2008/EC) is the EU regulation which governs the choice of law applicable to contractual obligations in civil and commercial matters. It replaces the 1980 Rome Convention and effects important structural changes to the rules for determining the applicable law, as well as the exceptions to those rules (the ‘choice of law gateways’). The English courts’ application of the gateways in the Rome Convention has been criticised as excessively flexible. While this view may be justified in relation to earlier cases decided on the Convention, there has been a gradual movement towards a more cautious judicial approach to both implied choice (Article 3) and the escape clause (Article 4), which was partly crystallised and partly precipitated by the changed architecture of these two provisions in the Rome I Regulation. I. Implied choice – Article 3 Rome IArticle 3(1) Rome I stipulates that where the parties have not made an express choice of law, courts may imply such a choice if it is ‘clearly demonstrated by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case’. This is a notable change from Article 3 of the Convention which only required that a real choice be ‘demonstrated with reasonable certainty’. (a) 'Terms of the contract'The most compelling evidence of a real but unexpress choice is the inclusion of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause as a contractual term. Jonathan Hill notes that in such cases, English courts imply a choice of the law of the forum ‘almost as a matter of course’. 1 Yet judges are arguably not abusing their discretion in doing so because (a) such an approach is sanctioned by Recital 12 of Rome I, and (b) other EU Member States do the same (notably Germany). Furthermore, an exclusive jurisdiction clause is arguably most indicative – out of all the factors which a court may consider – that the parties intended to make a choice of law, namely the law of the chosen forum. Therefore, in this respect, English judges’ use of the implied choice gateway is consistent with Article 3 and the overarching principle of the Rome regime: party autonomy. Nevertheless, English courts’ propensity to find implied choice of law on the basis of factors other than choice of forum clauses has sometimes been unwarranted. A notable example is the House of Lords’ judgment in Amin Rasheed Shipping Corp v Kuwait Insurance Co [1983] 3 WLR 241. Admittedly, Lord Diplock’s reasoning that contracts cannot exist in a ‘legal vacuum’ was founded on impeccable legal logic. However, the House of Lords’ decision to imply a choice of English law because the contract was based on the Lloyds marine policy standard form – which had to be interpreted by reference to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the English case law on it – was a stretch too far. Lord Diplock noted (quoting Bingham J, as he then was, in an earlier case) that the Lloyds policy was so widely used that it had become a ‘common currency’ for the international insurance business. Contrary to his view, however, precisely because it is so widely used it cannot realistically be presumed that all private parties in the world who choose the Lloyds form as their insurance policy also intend to choose English law to apply to their contractual disputes, if nothing else in the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case indicates such a choice. (b) 'Circumstances of the case'When applying this second discretionary limb of the implied choice gateway, English courts have shown more restraint. While Potter LJ in Aeolian Shipping SA v ISS Machinery Services Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 1162 reasoned that a wider range of factors could be considered under Article 3 than under the traditional common law approach to implication of terms, Mance LJ in American Motorists Insurance Co v Cellstar Corporation [2003] EWCA Civ 206 disagreed and formulated the ‘so obvious that it went without saying’ test. Its application in subsequent cases allowed English judges to remain within the boundaries of implication of a real choice, and not stray into the proscribed waters of imputation of a choice which was clearly not made but would have been reasonable. In light of this, the English courts’ approach to Article 3 has been overall satisfactory and there has not been overindulgence in search for an implied choice. This relatively strict approach of the English judges was crystallised by the new architecture of Rome I, whose emphasis on the objectives of certainty and predictability necessitates the curbing of interpretative flexibility. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be a major change in the English courts’ current application of the implied choice gateway. II. ‘manifestly more closely connected law’ – Article 4 Rome IIn contrast to their measured approach to Article 3, English courts have adopted too malleable an interpretation of Article 4, which applies when the parties have not made a choice of law. This is reflected in the higher threshold for the activation of the choice of law gateway in Rome I. First, the presumption in Article 4(2) of the Rome Convention that the law of the country where the characteristic performer habitually resides shall govern the contract has been raised to a rule in Rome I. And second, the escape clause in Article 4(5) of the Rome Convention, which enabled the displacement of the presumption in favour of another more closely connected law, has been reduced to a narrow exception in Article 4(3) Rome I. In the early Article 4 cases, English courts tended to find that the place of performance of the obligations characterising the contract was a more important localising factor than the place of habitual residence of the party performing it, and to conclude that the contract was more closely connected with the law of the former. In Samcrete Egypt Engineers &amp; Contractors SAE v Land Rover Exports Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 2019, the Court of Appeal found that English law rather than Egyptian law (where the characteristic performer had their habitual residence) governed the contract because the place of delivery and payment was England. Yet apart from these two connecting elements, there was nothing else linking the disputed contract to England. Indeed, as Hill argues, the court attached so little weight to the country of habitual residence of the characteristic performer that it can almost be said that it was presuming – contrary to the letter of the Convention – that the place of performance was the best indicator of the closest connection between law and contract. 2 The judgment of Morison J in Definitely Maybe (Touring) Ltd v Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur GmbH [2001] 1 WLR 1745 was an attempt to mediate between the weak and strong versions of the presumption. His strictly textual approach to construction led him to hold that Article 4(2) was intended to operate as a ‘normal rule’ which would be ‘simple to apply’ and would apply in the majority of cases, thereby bringing the English approach to Article 4 closer to the strong theory. Nevertheless, in judging that the presumption could be disregarded in cases where the factors connecting the contract to another country overwhelmingly prevail, he went on to do just that (interestingly, with the effect of stripping English courts of jurisdiction). In light of this judgment, and in line with Hill’s view, it appears that while English judges are speaking the language of the strong version of the presumption, in practice they would disregard it whenever the country of the habitual residence of the characteristic performer differs from the country where the characteristic performance actually takes place. 3 The most contentious scenario to which the escape clause has been applied (indeed, excessively flexibly) by English courts is when the contract at issue is part of a larger chain of transactions between multiple parties and jurisdictions.  Bank of Baroda v Vysya Bank Ltd [1994] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 87 concerned letters of credit which characteristically involve four parties – the issuing bank, confirming bank, beneficiary and debtor – each having individual bilateral contracts among themselves. As a matter of policy, it is preferable that they are all governed by the same law. Guided by this line of reasoning, Mance J displaced the Article 4(2) presumption as regards the contract between the beneficiary and the issuing bank, finding that the contract was more closely connected with England than India because the letter was issued through National Westminster Bank in London. Manuel Penadés Fons has defended the English judges’ approach in such chains of contracts scenarios, arguing that they are merely responding to commercial realities and aiming to give commercially sound decisions. 4 In support, he refers to Recitals 20 and 21 of Rome I and Article 4(1)(h) which recognise the practicality of there being a single law governing all contracts within the same complex multilateral transaction. 5 Thus, English courts’ approach to Article 4 is in his view ‘nuanced’ and context-dependent in a way which does not contravene the Rome Convention, and will not contravene the Rome I Regulation. 6 Although the added qualifier ‘manifestly’ in Article 4(3) Rome I suggests an intention to limit the opportunistic exercise of judicial discretion, context will always be everything when there is no definitive guidance on the application of the escape clause. 7 However, there remains a conceptual difficulty in determining which contractual relationship to examine first in the search for a single applicable law. The arbitrariness of this choice was evident in Bank of Baroda where the court began its analysis from the contract between the issuing bank and the confirming bank which pointed to England. As Hill suggests in his evaluation of Mance J’s reasoning, it is in fact the contract between the issuing bank and the beneficiary which should be considered first since the beneficiary’s acceptance of it sets in motion the chain of all subsequent transactions. 8 The Commercial Court in Molton Street Capital LLP v Shooters Hill Capital Partners LLP [2015] EWHC 3419 – the first English case on Article 4 Rome I – seems to have recognised this when it reasoned that the contracts above and below a contract for the sale of junk bonds were not connecting factors strong enough to displace the Article 4(2) presumption. This most recent English judgement is in line with the new wording of Article 4(3) Rome I in that it reflects the principle of exceptionality enshrined in the word ‘manifestly’. It remains to be seen whether or not it will mark the start of a stricter usage of the escape clause by English judges. ConclusionThe architectural changes effected by the Rome I Regulation to the European rules for choice of law in contract place an enhanced emphasis on the goal of predictability at the expense of flexibility. English courts – although having often been excessively opportunistic in their use of the choice of law gateways under the Rome Convention – have recently started exhibiting a trend of restraint more in line with the new Rome I provisions, and exercising their discretion more sparingly and conscientiously. Whether this trend will continue is the subject of speculation.  [1]Jonathan Hill, ‘Choice of Law in Contract Under the Rome Convention: The Approach of the UK Courts’ (2004) 53 ICLQ 325, 329.

    "title": "The Undisclosed Principal: Limiting Liability for Negligent Misrepresentations",
    "body": "2018/09/27 - Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SPA v Playboy Club London Limited and others [2018] UKSC 43 concerns a claim for pure economic loss due to a negligent misrepresentation. It sets a precedent for cases that concern a duty of care between a statement-maker and third party undisclosed principal. At first glance, the instant case appears consistent to Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd1. Yet, on closer examination, it contains several distinctive material facts. Hassan Barakat, a Lebanese national, wished to gamble at Playboy Club London (“the Club”). He applied for a cheque cashing facility for up to £800,000, allowing him to present a cheque and obtain chips to an equivalent value before that cheque was to be cashed. Following the Club’s protocol for welcoming new players, Bakarat was required to obtain a credit reference from his bankers for twice the amount of the cheque cashing facility (£1. 6 million). To preserve customer confidentiality at the Club, the Club hired Burlington Street Services (“Burlington”), an associated company, to obtain the credit reference on their behalf. Soon after, Barakat returned to Lebanon, taking his winnings with him. Both cheques Bakarat had cashed were returned unpaid, and the Club suffered a net loss of £802,940. The Club began proceedings against the Bank for the loss they had incurred, arguing the Bank owed them a duty of care to exercise reasonable skill in preparing the credit reference. However, the Court of Appeal held that a duty of care was only owed by the Bank to Burlington as they were the addressee of the reference. The Club appealed the decision, but its appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Supreme Court. Notably, the fact the Club had remained Burlington’s undisclosed principal carried the most weight in determining why the Court reached the decision it did. This material fact established that a party cannot voluntarily assume responsibility towards someone they are not aware is privy to their agreement. Moreover, it helped inform the two main arguments the Court adopted in dismissing the appeal, one centered around the voluntary assumption of responsibility and the other concerning relationships equivalent to contract. Voluntary Assumption of ResponsibilityIn dismissing the claim that the Bank had voluntarily assumed responsibility to the Club and thus owed a duty of care, the Court turned to examine the most influential precedent on pure economic loss: Hedley Byrne. The Hedley Byrne principle establishes that a duty of care arises where there is a ‘special’ relationship between A and B. This special relationship must satisfy two tests: A assumes responsibility for a negligent misrepresentation in knowing that B will rely on their statement, and B must proceed to rely on that statement. Only once B’s reasonable reliance upon A’s statement can be established does a duty of care exist. Furthermore, a party cannot assume responsibility to the world at large. In Hedley Byrne, Heller understood that their statement was to be relied upon by ‘an unidentified but readily identifiable’ client on whose behalf the National Provincial Bank was known to be making an inquiry. Yet, in Banca Nazionale, there was no evidence that the Bank knew its credit reference would be communicated to anyone other than Burlington. In Hedley Byrne, the reference in question was relied upon by the party to whom it was addressed. However, in Banca Nazionale, the reference was relied upon by Burlington’s undisclosed principal, the Club. Since the Bank had in no way assumed responsibility towards the Club, the Court dismissed the claim that the Bank owed it a duty of care. This decision is sound insofar as it prevents holding a statement-maker ‘liable in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class’2 for breach of an alleged duty of care regarding the accuracy of their statement. This reasoning will be favourably welcomed by banks and others frequently called upon to provide references. On a broader scale however, it is useful to analyse where limitations of the assumption of responsibility principle lie. As Hartshorne argues, a review of contemporary judicial decisions such as HM Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc3 and Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority4 suggests that the concept should no longer be regarded as the touchstone of liability in pure economic loss claims5. This is because there has been a movement away from applying the assumption of responsibility principle as a determinant of whether a duty of care exists. The Caparo tripartite test has been one stepping stone towards this direction, and Robinson will likely be the other (which suggests there is in fact no definitive test for identifying a duty of care). Favoured by judges, both of these developments effectively render the assumption of responsibility principle theoretically obsolete. This speaks to the status quo that the assumption of responsibility principle no longer plays the same dominant role it once did, and calls into question how the law of negligent misstatements may be shaped (if at all) by cases such as Banca Nazionale. This is particularly significant when it can be argued that the Supreme Court’s decision to dismiss the Club’s appeal works in favour of trying to maintain a limit on the class of persons to whom a duty can be owed, preserving the function of what the assumption of responsibility principle seeks to achieve. Relationships Equivalent to ContractThe Court also dismissed the claim that the Club’s relationship with the Bank was equivalent to a contract. The Club’s counsel sought to rely on Lord Devlin’s argument in Hedley Byrne, arguing that because the relationship between the Bank and the Club was equivalent to contract, the Club was therefore entitled to declare itself and assume the benefit of the contract. This submission was rejected by the Court because it relied on the assumption that because a relationship akin to contract is generally sufficient in finding a duty of care, it follows that the legal elements of a contractual relationship are automatically imposed in the relationship. Extending privity of contract to an undisclosed principal not party to a contract between an agent and third party would open the floodgates of liability to the extent that any party issuing a statement may be at risk of having a claim brought against them for inaccuracy. Is this claim’s dismissal an indication that the law on undisclosed principals may soon be reformed? The Court’s actions certainly make reform seem plausible, with Lord Sumption asserting that the law relating to undisclosed principals is one that survives ‘on account of its antiquity rather than its coherence’.   However, as Reynolds argues, ‘clear cases of the law’s application are comparatively few, and judgments that are less than 100 years old even fewer’6. ConclusionFollowing dismissal of both the arguments made for the voluntary assumption of responsibility principle and relationships equivalent to contract, Lord Sumption made the following clear: where A has passed a statement onto B that has been passed onto C, A owes C no duty of care unless he knew that the statement was likely to be communicated to C and it was part of the statement’s known purpose to be communicated to and relied upon by C. Evident here is the Court’s desire to limit exposure to liability. While Hedley Byrne establishes the principle that a party can be liable for a negligent misstatement to a third party to whom they had not directly provided a reference to, Banca Nazionale further clarifies that a reference is fruitless if obtained for an unidentifiable third party. This shows the Court actively distinguishing between the facts of the two cases to clarify the limits of liability, which helps to illustrate the parameters the court will stick to in allowing a claim for damages. The arguments presented in Banca Nazionale do a good job of microcosmically illustrating the law on pure economic loss. They highlight that the boundaries of the voluntary assumption of responsibility principle remain narrow to avoid excessive liability. They also help to reiterate the Court’s opinion that the Hedley Byrne principle is the only exception to the rule that pure economic loss is not recoverable, plain from Lord Mance’s conclusion in his concurring judgment that had Burlington been the operator of the gaming club and suffered the loss, the claim would have succeeded. This bears the impression that the courts are keen on remaining with the principle established in Hedley Byrne, and that they are content with not allowing unknown third parties (or undisclosed principals)to recover for pure economic loss.

    "title": "The 'Live-in Requirement' for Foreign Domestic Helpers in Hong Kong: Fundamental Rights at Risk?",
    "body": "2018/09/13 - Case note: Lubiano v The Director of Immigration HCAL 210/2016 In Lubiano v The Director of Immigration HCAL 210/2016, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance considered a judicial review application for the ‘Live-in Requirement’ applicable to Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs). There are over 357,000 Foreign Domestic Workers in Hong Kong, mostly coming from the Philippines and Indonesia (as of March 2017). They are admitted to work under the FDW scheme, which was set up in 1969 to meet local demand for full-time domestic services, typically for household chores and child or elderly care. The ‘Live-in Requirement’ is a key feature of the Standard Employment Contract of the FDW scheme: it dictates that FDWs must live in their employer’s residence where they work. In Lubiano, the second of the four grounds for review advanced by the Applicant is that the Live-in requirement exposes FDWs to a heightened risk of their fundamental rights being violated in a manner that is disproportionate and therefore unconstitutional. The analysis which lead the court to dismiss the ground is of particular interest in this article. First, the court examined the preliminary question of what fundamental rights FDWs hold (if any). The first group of rights considered were those contained within the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BoR), which prohibits “servitude” under Article 4(2) and “forced or compulsory labour” under Article 4(3)(a). The court found that FDWs were precluded from relying on this group of rights due to Section 11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance Cap 383 (HKBORO), which states that: “As regards persons not having the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong, this Ordinance does not affect any immigration legislation governing entry into, stay in and departure from Hong Kong, or the application of any such legislation”. In the earlier case of Ubamaka [2012] HKCFA 87, it was held that certain rights (specifically those under Article 3 of the BoR against torture and inhumane treatment) were non-derogable (as established in Section 5(2)(c) of the HKBORO) and absolute, and therefore excepted from the scope of Section 11. However, the court purported to distinguish Ubamaka from the present case. First, it highlighted that although Section 5(2) of the HKBORO qualifies Article 4(2) of the BoR as “non-derogable”, Ribeiro PJ in Ubamaka was “at pains to emphasise that the analysis [in Ubamaka regarding Article 3] does not necessarily apply to other rights listed in Section 5(2)” [Lubiano at 98, Ubamaka at 134-140]. Additionally, Section 5(2) does not cover Article 4(3)(a) of the BoR. Second, it asserted that both Article 4(2) and Article 4(3)(a) “[are] not, or [have] not been proven to be, ‘absolute’” [Lubiano at 98(1), (2)]. However, an examination of the reasoning in Ubamaka reveals that the assessment of whether the rights in question were ‘absolute’ was based on precedents from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the UK Supreme Court [Ubamaka at 7, 106]. Taking the same route in the present case, based on the ECtHR case Siliadin v. France (Application no. 73316/01), rights under Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights (which corresponds to Article 4 of the BoR) are also considered ‘absolute’. The judge in Lubiano failed to address Article 3 and Article 4’s similar status in foreign precedents, and why he nevertheless considered Article 4 not to be absolute. This leaves ample room for one to question the judge’s purported distinction between Lubiano and Ubamaka, upon which the Section 11 preclusion of FDWs from this first group of rights is based. Additionally, the court made the prima facie assumption that Section 11 does apply to FDWs, thereby ignoring the other issue which Ubamaka raises, namely that Section 11 only applies to “persons not having the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong”. In Ubamaka, the court indicated that Section 11 does not apply to permanent residents or “Hong Kong residents or others who are lawfully entitled to be in Hong Kong” [46]. Similarly, in Bahadur v Director of Immigration (2002) 5 HKCFAR 480, the court found that the decision to deny re-entry to a non-permanent resident who left Hong Kong territory within his limit of stay was unlawful because bringing short his limit of stay infringed his rights to travel and enter under Article 31 of the Basic Law. The judgement was based on the assumption that the decision to deny re-entry was not precluded by Section 11, because non-permanent residents have the “right to enter and remain in Hong Kong”. What then remains to be established is whether there is a distinction between an FDW and a non-permanent resident: both are admitted into Hong Kong for a period of time and can leave then re-enter any time within that period, as opposed to a visitor whose visa lapses upon exit, or someone who enters unlawfully. The court’s assumption that Section 11 applies is a procedural error in law that weakens its ultimate conclusion that FDWs cannot access this first group of fundamental rights. Regarding other potentially accessible rights, the court considered an alleged international customary rule prohibiting forced labour put forth by the Applicant. But the court rightly found that under the Basic Law that it would not be within its competence to declare and enforce international customary law. The court also considered alleged rights to safe and healthy working conditions, adequate rest, leisure, limitation on working hours, and periodic holidays with pay under Article 7(b) and (d) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), as well as Article 6(1)(a)(i) of the Migration for Employment Convention 1949 (MEC). But, again, it found that although these provisions were applicable to Hong Kong as a matter of international law, they could not be enforced or relied upon within the domestic court without having been implemented by domestic law. Thus, the court concluded that on the preliminary question of what applicable fundamental rights FDWs have access to, the answer was that there were none. Nevertheless, the court went on to consider the hypothetical effect of the aforementioned rights on the Applicant’s central claim: that the Live-in Requirement exposes FDWs to a heightened risk of their engaged fundamental rights being violated in a manner that is disproportionate and therefore unconstitutional. Unlike orthodox fundamental rights claims, this claim presumes that the court has the jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of a governmental measure on the basis that it increases the risk of violation of a fundamental right. The court acknowledged that there are overseas authorities supporting this principle, but emphasised that there is “no local decision which directly applies” [Lubiano at 55]. However, as the Respondent in the present case did not dispute that such a principle exists, the court “proceed[ed] on the assumption (without deciding)” (ibid at [57]; emphasis added) that a governmental measure may be challenged on constitutional grounds if it increases the risk of violation of a fundamental right, but only when it does so “unacceptably” or “significantly” (as qualified by the Respondent; ibid at [54]). In purposefully “[not] deciding” if this principle actually exists under Hong Kong law, the court missed a key opportunity to examine whether Hong Kong could follow overseas authorities in developing an overriding principle that a system is unlawful if it carries, inherent within it, an unacceptable risk of illegality. Finally, the court evaluated whether there was in fact sufficient evidence to hypothetically support the claim that the Live-in Requirement “unacceptably” or “significantly” heightens the risk of violating the fundamental rights of FDWs. The court here examined several pieces of evidence, ranging from previous cases of FDW abuse by employers to studies and surveys carried out by non-governmental organisations. The court concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the claim. However, the analysis employed by the court in coming to this conclusion raises the question of whether it was even within the court’s competence to make such an assessment. Regarding the case example of Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, who suffered grievous bodily harm at the hands of her employer, it was pointed out that since the nature of providing domestic service requires the FDW to work at the employer’s residence, the Live-in Requirement only increases the number of opportunities available to the employer to abuse the FDW. Yet, the court asserted that it was “by no means satisfied” that the risk of ill-treatment was unacceptably or significantly increased [Lubiano at 82]. It is unclear upon what evidential basis this later conclusion was reached, which is particularly disquieting when the court is not an expert in this area. Similarly, regarding a study conducted by the Justice Centre on the prevalence of forced labour in Hong Kong, the court considered that the majority of the indicators used by the study “[…] cannot, in [its] view, be attributed to the Live-in Requirement” [Lubiano at 91(3)(c)]. Again, the court appears to have reached a conclusion which it may not have been qualified to reach. Thus, the court’s analysis here exposes the potential dangers of substantive review. In conclusion, the court in Lubiano decided that the potential heightened risk of a fundamental rights violation is not a sufficient deterrent for the implementation of a governmental measure. Skirting several key issues, while overstepping its competence in others, the court showed Hong Kong the lengths to which it is prepared to go in order to protect the existing measures of the FDW scheme.

    "title": "No Cake for You: The Legal Battle for Equal Treatment in Lee v McArthur & Ors",
    "body": "2018/09/08 - Lee v McArthur &amp; Ors [2016] NICA 39, commonly known as the ‘Gay Wedding Cake’ case, is currently awaiting judgment from the UK Supreme Court (‘UKSC’).  Lee promises to provide vital guidance on how conflicts between the LGBT and faith community should be resolved commercially. This article analyses the judgment handed down by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal (‘NICA’) and concludes that, despite the controversy, an outcome against the bakery is legally unsurprising and desirable within a commercial context. Mr Lee, a homosexual man from Northern Ireland, ordered a cake from Ashers Bakery with the printed words “Support Gay Marriage”. However, the bakery’s directors – being devoted Christians – opposed the introduction of same-sex marriage because it was in their view contrary to God’s law. Consequently, Mr and Mrs McArthur (the bakery directors) telephoned Mr Lee notifying him that the order could not be fulfilled. Unhappy with this outcome, Mr Lee brought two discrimination claims against Ashers bakery and its directors. First, on the ground of sexual orientation in breach of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (NI) 2006 (‘the 2006 Regulations’). Second, on the ground of religious belief or political opinion contrary to the Fair Employment and Treatment (NI) Order 1998 (‘the 1998 Order’). Challenging these claims, the bakery argued that both statutory provisions breached their rights under Articles 9, 10 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’). In the lower courts, the County Court and NICA held that Mr Lee was directly discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation and political opinion. In addition, both courts agreed that the provisions were compatible with Articles 9, 10 and 14. After the NICA decision, the parties now look towards the highest appellate court for Northern Ireland, the UKSC, for final judgment. The arguments presented in Lee are similar to those found in Bull and another v Hall and another [2013] UKSC 73.  Bull concerns a devout hotelier that only provided double bedroom accommodation to married couples. The hotelier denied the guest, who was in a civil partnership, a double bedroom. Fenton-Glynn observes that the UKSC was fractured in deciding the legal ground upon which the outcome was based1. For the majority, there was direct discrimination against the guest. Lady Hale (with whom Lord Toulson and Lord Kerr agreed) stated that there was great difficulty “in seeing how discriminating between a married and a civilly partnered person can be anything other than direct discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation”2. In contrast, Lord Neuberger and Lord Hughes argued that the discrimination could only be indirect because the hoteliers would have denied a room to any non-married, heterosexual or homosexual couple3. This distinction between direct and indirect discrimination is of critical importance as the 2006 Regulations provides that indirect discrimination may be justified, whilst direct discrimination cannot. The court’s analysis on direct and indirect discrimination in Bull is useful to consider in the context of the present case. Although the source of the discrimination in Lee can be distinguished from that in Bull, the NICA still held that Mr Lee was directly discriminated against. The court’s decision was due to Mr Lee’s association with the LGBT community. The court held that “the benefit from the message or slogan on the cake could only accrue to gay or bisexual people”4. Since “ … the use of the word ‘Gay’ in the context of the message prevented the order from being fulfilled”, the bakery had thus refused to associate themselves with the LGBT community5. Moreover, they would not have opposed a cake that said “Support Marriage” or “Support Heterosexual Marriage”. As the 2006 Regulations protects the sexual orientation of the LGBT community, this was a case of direct discrimination. Yet, this is not a novel or odd concept - associative direct discrimination has been a feature of anti-discrimination law since Coleman v Attridge Law [2008] ECJ C-303/06. In this case, Ms Coleman was forced to resign from her job because she had a disabled child. The Employment Tribunal, with the clarification of the European Court of Justice, held that Ms Coleman was directly discriminated against because she was associated with her disabled son. Alternatively, the court may find Lee to be a case of indirect discrimination. Although the NICA refused to comment on the possibility of indirect discrimination6, the UKSC should consider doing so in the interests of clarity. The regulations provide that the bakery must apply a provision, criterion or practice to Mr Lee which would also apply equally to persons not of the same sexual orientation. In this case, the bakery applied a “Support Gay Marriage” criterion to Mr Lee and all other customers. To prove indirect discrimination, the criterion applied must fulfil three requirements outlined in the regulations7. First, the criterion must place persons of Mr Lee’s sexual orientation at a particular disadvantage when compared with others. Second, the criterion must place Mr Lee at a disadvantage. Third, the bakery must show that the criterion applied is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. By refusing to bake the cake with the words “Support Gay Marriage” for any customer, the bakery puts homosexual individuals at a particular disadvantage because the message could only ever benefit homosexuals and the LGBT community. In addition, the criterion puts Mr Lee at a disadvantage due to his association with and campaign for same-sex marriage. Finally, whilst the bakers have a legitimate aim in protecting their religious beliefs, a proportionate approach would be “to refuse service [for] any religious or political message”8. It would be a disproportionate measure to provide a service that only fully benefits those with religious or political views the bakery agrees with. As a result, the court could conclude that the bakers indirectly discriminated against Mr Lee. In addition, the NICA held that the bakery and its directors directly discriminated against Mr Lee on the ground of religious belief or political opinion9. It is significant that Northern Ireland’s legislature has tried five times between 2012 and 2015 to pass a Marriage Equality Act that would bring legal equivalence between Northern Ireland and the UK. The NICA and County Court noted that, given the political context, it is plain that support or opposition for gay marriage is regarded as a political opinion. For instance, the bakery would not have opposed a cake that read “Support Heterosexual Marriage” and it is evident that the bakery was opposed to gay marriage10. In rejecting the cake, the bakery did not wish to support individuals who held that view. However, the bakery cannot provide a service that only “reflects their own political or religious belief”11. As a result, the court should conclude that the directors directly discriminated against Mr Lee on the basis of his political opinion. The UKSC was also asked to adjudicate on whether the 2006 Regulations and 1998 Order breached Article 9 and 10 of the ECHR. Both rights may be limited if they “are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society”12. First, the bakery directors argued that the message was a form of forced speech and contrary to their Article 10 rights. However, the approach the Supreme Court should take is to acknowledge that when a baker conducts a business for profit, he does not associate himself with the message of his cake. For example, a cake celebrating a sports team’s victory does not indicate any support for that team from the baker. Particularly when other types of cakes are considered, the claim that a message is a form of forced speech loses its strength. On the evidence provided by the parties, the NICA found that the cake Mr Lee sought from the bakery was within the normal range of cakes it offered . The bakery advertised services for the transfer of an image and message onto a cake (subject to their terms and conditions). Therefore, the directors were not forced to speak because they had offered the service to the public on their terms. Second, the directors engaged Article 9 by manifesting their religious belief to oppose gay marriage because it was in their view contrary to God’s law. However, the regulations limiting the exercise of religious beliefs must be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. In this case, the legitimate aim of the 2006 Regulations is the protection of the rights and freedoms of Mr Lee and equal treatment in the commercial sphere. Lady Hale in Bull noted that the continuing legacy of discrimination against homosexuals should not be underestimated; Strasbourg requires “very weighty reasons to justify discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation”13. Analogously, the 1998 Order protects Mr Lee’s freedom to hold political opinions that the bakery may disagree with and to ensure equal treatment in the commercial sphere regardless of his views. As a result, the court should hesitate to rule that prohibiting service providers from discriminating against homosexuals and individuals with different political beliefs is a disproportionate limitation on their rights. The implications of Lee are significant. An outcome in favour of Mr Lee will not only protect members of the LGBT community, but all individuals with protected characteristics under legislation. As a result, the UKSC should reach the same conclusion against a gay-baker discriminating against devout Catholics by refusing a cake with the message “Support Jesus”14. The claims made by the bakery should be dismissed to ensure that we live in “a society where all individuals are treated equally regardless of the colour of their skin, their sexual orientation, or indeed, their religion”15. The decisions made by the County Court and the NICA are welcomed in ensuring equal treatment in the commercial sphere. As the NICA concluded, a service provider “may not provide a service that only reflects their own political or religious belief in relation to sexual orientation”16. Therefore, the UKSC should follow the decisions of the lower courts and dismiss the claims made by the bakery.  [1]C Fenton-Glynn, ‘Replacing One Type of Oppression with Another?

    "title": "European Integration, Brexit and Democracy: What do we do now?",
    "body": "2018/08/10 - Over the past two decades, the European Union has experienced an increased disjuncture between its political vision for peace, prosperity and security and the democratic mandate of the people. This disconnect has been vociferously animated by sundry arguments of principle during the United Kingdom’s EU referendum in June 2016, the seismic decision by the UK to leave the EU as well as the continuing negotiations over exit terms between the UK government and the EU. When the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 received Royal Assent two months ago,  it marked a weighty moment in Britain’s troubled history with Europe. It represented democratic resistance to the EU’s politically hegemonic tunnel vision. In this article, I want to make three arguments about an overly-scrutinised and perhaps fatigued project of the EU: European integration. First, I want to offer a theoretical explanation for faltering European integration. Second, I want to advance some reasons why we should be cautious about European integration post-Brexit. Finally, I will tentatively grapple with how European integration ought to be structured. I. Faltering European integrationPost-2009, the constitutional conundrum created by the EU’s response to the European debt crisis alienated transnational cooperation between member states. Coalesced against competing national interests which swayed in favour of larger member states and the increasing hegemony of the European Council and European Commission, deep-seated tensions emerged between market pressures and the people’s demands. The single currency had a specific ordo-liberal direction with Greece experiencing its effects first-hand. The election of Syriza in 2015 on an anti-austerity platform and the Greek Oxi referendum (where not a single region voted in favour of the bailout conditions spearheaded by the Commission) were managerially ignored by the EU. Greece was compelled to agree to stricter bailout conditions than had been posited in the referendum. Given the disequilibrium between the democratic mandate of the people and the EU’s seemingly interchangeable economic and political vision, the criticism hurled at the project of European integration is unsurprising. After all, to get rid of the EU’s institutional handcuffs is a fair reason to wish to exit the EU. Yet, the UK exited the EU without the European debt crisis as its most cogent justification. So what then triggered British disquiet about the EU? Perhaps the answer is found in Vote Leave’s alluring slogan: ‘take back control’. Behind this sits the most common objection: that the EU disturbs, disrupts and threatens British sovereignty. Yet, in reality, it has more to do with today’s uneasiness that arises from the historical constitutional nature of the EU legal order. There are three key problems with the EU legal order that have less to do with its design than its purpose. First, its ‘political messianism’. Writing in 2011, Joseph Weiler identified the political messianism of the European integration project by exploring the 868-word Schuman Declaration, akin to Europe’s very own Declaration of Independence1. Its post-World War II rhetoric of peace, prosperity and the reconstruction of Europe omit that of democracy, accountability and representation. Hence, the justification for European integration was the ‘promise of a better future’2. In these terms, the European project of integration began as a peacekeeping mission, with democracy aloof. This then informs the second and third problems with the European construct: the democratic deficit and legitimacy crisis. Often intertwined and historically contingent, the median EU citizen lacks the ability to hold its leaders accountable for their decisions, is unable to directly influence the outcome of policy choices as they would be able to at national level and is increasingly distant to EU institutions, with electoral turnout rates at European Parliament elections declining with every cycle. Yet, these problems come not because the EU has failed in its mission to strengthen post-war European relationships, but because it is now tasked by its leaders to fulfil a role contemporary European society simply believes to be beyond its scope. II. European integration post-BrexitThe European project of integration calls for a conceptual reassessment of the EU’s design in light of contextual factors throughout its 60-year history. The strength of the dialectical relationship between the people and the EU’s institutions with its peaks and troughs has markedly been influenced by the fluidity of crises. Nonetheless at present, there remain reasons to be positive. First, the Eurozone is no longer in a state of emergency after the stronger monitoring of banking and finance regulations cajoled the financial markets. Second, Europe’s refugee and migrant crisis is somewhat subsiding (though border deaths have surged3). Third, recent elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany have witnessed the defeat of right-wing populism (this strain of populism being a fear of the establishment). Bearing this in mind, it could be said the EU is turning a corner, and the UK’s departure from the EU will leave the 27 remaining member states readier to take on the world’s challenges. Yet, the feeling of apprehension that tickles the thought of a stronger EU lingers. In GDP terms, the UK’s departure is equivalent to losing the 19 smallest member states4. On one hand, Brexit presents an opportunity for the EU to unite against British awkwardness in the continuing negotiations over exit terms. On the other, it closes the door on British scepticism that has blocked progress to an ever-closer union among the member states in areas such as defence, social policy and direct taxation. At first, it may appear like closing the door on a reputably obstructive partner is a good thing for European integration. However, the graveyards of Bosnia, national banks’ continuous overexposure to sovereign debt and the 120 million EU citizens living at risk of poverty and social exclusion is evidence that habits of cooperation and consensus-building cannot magically happen through treaty change, directives and regulations in such a short period. In this view, European integration – at least what is sought by the EU’s current leaders – is an intergenerational battle of monomaniacal proportions. Who now will question the fusion of member states on issues like the internal market, fundamental rights and the Eurozone? As such, the UK’s withdrawal from the EU signifies the loss of a vocal check and balance tempering the fervency of European integration. Although this loss is prima facie a pragmatic issue, it also presages that fast-moving and deeper integration of the EU is likely a self-fulfilling prophecy of folly. III. The future for European integrationSince current European integration is not necessarily palatable to democracy and deeper integration seems unconvincing, is the answer to reform the EU or hold this middle ground (i. e. restricting national autonomy while pushing non-political integration)? I have three hesitantly skeletal points in response. First, at least for now, it is unlikely that other member states will follow the UK out of the EU. Current negotiations show the UK struggling to look like a nation capable of leading the world on key issues; internally, the UK is divided. Second, from a historical constitutional perspective, the EU was originally ‘a-democratic’. But, in many ways, the EU has become a threat to democracy – consider Greece, where the people became victims of a militant democratic model believing the tyrannical majority cannot be trusted5. As such, reforming the EU’s design is a viable solution. Some have suggested a mode of radical pluralism – a fluid system with no decided supreme authority, where laws and integration occur flexibly in an incremental process while maintaining legitimacy through national parliaments6. Although this allows for a powerful review of the EU’s constitutional identity, it may hardly lead to genuine compromise if the EU truly wishes to respect national constitutional autonomy. Consequently, this leads to the third key point. Since this middle ground is visibly unstable, stripping the EU’s treaties to their basic constitutional elements could mean retaining EU supremacy only in areas deemed to be the EU’s own constitutional identity (i. e. those elements collectively determined by the member states). Ultimately, this would mean maintaining national democracy (which allows EU citizens to hold their representatives accountable), while constitutionalising core EU principles7. Although it may not be an ideal solution, it is a little more pleasant than others. Candidly, the European project of integration is too far down the line for member states to multilaterally abandon, but without some measures being taken to re-design the European construct, it may only take a few more decades for it to implode. If substantive changes are not made to the EU legal order and Brexit turns out to be a success, the effect on European integration will be significant. Yet, the same is also true of its reverse. In the present moment, perhaps all that can be said is that compared to other options available, the better able the EU can overcome the challenges it faces and demonstrate its ability to connect democratic voices with governance, European integration may not be faltered just yet.

    "title": "Employees or Independent Contractors: What Defines a “Worker”?",
    "body": "2018/08/02 - Pimlico Plumbers Limited v Smith [2018] UKSC 29 deals with several important issues concerning an intermediate category of working people falling between an “employee” under a contract of service and those who work for others as independent contractors. The final appeal decision clarifies the meaning of “worker” under section 230(3)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (‘ERA’), Regulation 2(1) of the Working Time Regulations 1998 (‘the Regulations’) and section 83(2) of the Equality Act 2010 (‘the Equality Act’). Mr Smith is a plumbing and heating engineer. Pimlico Plumbers (‘Pimlico’) is a London-based plumbing business. For almost six years, Mr Smith carried out work for Pimlico. Under the two agreements he had entered into, Pimlico was not obliged to provide Mr Smith work, and he was not obliged to accept any work provided. Tragically, in 2011, Mr Smith suffered a heart attack. After requesting for a three-day week from Pimlico on his doctor’s advice, he was sacked. Following this, he brought claims against Pimlico in an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal, unlawful wage deductions, unpaid annual leave and disability discrimination. The tribunal concluded that he was not an “employee” within the meaning of section 230(1) of the ERA to bring an unfair dismissal claim. However, he was a “worker” under section 230(3)(b) of the ERA and regulation 2(1) of the Regulations. Further, he had been in “employment” under section 83(2) of Equality Act. Pimlico Plumbers appealed these three decisions at the EAT and Court of Appeal. These attempts were unsuccessful, and their arguments again failed before a unanimous Supreme Court (Lord Wilson, Lady Hale, Lord Hughes, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd-Jones). Under section 230(3) of the ERA, a “worker” is not only defined as, at (a) an individual who is employed under a contract of service, but also at (b), as: “an individual who has entered into or works under … any other contract … whereby the individual undertakes to … perform personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual …” Reconciling the definition of “workers” against its legislative backdrop, the Supreme Court found that regulation 2(1) of the Regulations defined “worker” in identical terms to section 230(3)(b) of the ERA. At first glance, the definition of “employment” under the Equality Act appears to be different to the concept of “worker” within the meaning of section 230(3)(b) of the ERA and regulation 2(1) of the Regulations. However, following Lady Hale’s observations in Bates van Winkelhof v Clyde &amp; Co LLP [2014] UKSC 32, Lord Wilson noted that this was in fact a distinction without difference. He pointed to Lady Hale’s observations to demonstrate that the operation of section 83(2)(a) of the Equality Act yielded similar economical results to section 230(3)(b) of the ERA and regulation 2(1) of the Regulations, and that this was conceptually legitimate to treat the three decisions as being founded on the question of whether Mr Smith was a “worker” under section 230(3)(b) of the ERA. However, Lord Wilson failed to address how exactly van Winkelhof equated the definition of a “worker” under section 230(3)(b) of the ERA with section 83(2)(a) of the Equality Act. In many ways, this was a lost opportunity, especially with concern to the restrictive approach of Jivraj v Hashwani [2011] UKSC 40 when interpreting “employment” under section 83(2)(a) of the Equality Act. There were two key legal tests Mr Smith had to satisfy if he was to qualify as a “worker” under section 230(3)(b) of the ERA. The first was that Mr Smith had undertaken to “perform personally” his work for Pimlico, and the second that Pimlico was not to be regarded as Mr Smith’s client or customer. Under the first test, the Court was concerned as to whether Mr Smith’s right to substitute another Pimlico operative was inconsistent with his obligation of personal performance. Ultimately, the employment tribunal, the EAT and the Court of Appeal did not consider Mr Smith’s right to substitute as negating his obligation of personal performance. Challenging this analysis, Pimlico directed the Court’s attention to Halawi v WDFG UK Ltd (t/a World Duty Free) [2014] EWCA Civ 1387 and Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd v Gunning [1986] ICR 145 but these cases did nothing to assist in determining where the boundary lay between the right to substitute and personal performance. Rather, it was in the analysis of James v Redcats (Brands) Ltd [2007] ICR 1006 and Jivraj where the Court held that it was helpful to assess the significance of Mr Smith’s right to substitute by analysing “whether the dominant feature of the contract remained personal performance on his part”. This is a welcome clarificatory approach by the Supreme Court in the assessment of personal performance as it means the lower courts and tribunals should favour to analyse, not merely the purpose of the contract, but its main substance. On the facts of Pimlico Plumbers, the Court found that the right to substitute was “so insignificant as not to be worthy of recognition”. Mr Smith warranting his competence and skills, the requirement for him to uphold a high standard of conduct and that he must carry his Pimlico ID card at all times when working for the Company cumulatively went to show that he had undertaken to “perform personally” his work for Pimlico. Pimlico’s argument that these requirements were capable of applying to anyone who substituted for him was unpersuasive to the Court because it stretched their “natural meaning beyond breaking-point”. Hence, the fact that the contractual right to substitute was limited to other Pimlico operatives was important, as this type of substitute would have had to equally fulfil Pimlico’s “suite of heavy obligations”. It is worth noting that the Court’s analysis had little to do with the law, but is a reminder that contradictory objectives in contractual drafting only causes confusion, and in this context, concurrently benefits the “worker”. Under the second test, the question was whether the extent of Pimlico’s contractual obligation to offer Mr Smith work and the extent of his obligation to accept the work offered to him evidenced a lack of subordination consistent with Pimlico being no more than his client or customer (the Court applied Windle v Secretary of State for Justice[2016] ICR 721, at [23], per Underhill LJ). The Supreme Court held that the EAT and Court of Appeal were entitled to find that Pimlico had a contractual obligation to offer Mr Smith work if it was available, whereas Mr Smith’s obligation was to keep himself available for up to 40 hours a week to accept any work Pimlico might offer him (but without prejudice to his right to decline what he is offered). Hence, it was legitimate to find that there was an “umbrella contract” between Pimlico and Mr Smith. This was an understandable approach for the Supreme Court to adopt, however the extension of mutuality of obligation beyond employee status is deeply problematic (see: J Prassl, “Pimlico Plumbers, Uber Drivers, Cycle Couriers, and Court Translators: Who is a Worker?” (2017) 33 LQR (forthcoming)). Pimlico made a number of arguments including that: Mr Smith was entitled to reject any work offered and the financial risks and advantages followed from Mr Smith’s work for Pimlico. However, the Court felt that other features of the contract “strongly mitigated” against recognising Pimlico as a client or customer of Mr Smith. In scathing words, Lord Wilson stated that the “severe terms as to when and how much [Pimlico] was obliged to pay him…betrayed a grip on his economy inconsistent with his being a truly independent contractor”. In consequence, it was the Supreme Court’s view that Pimlico could not be regarded as Mr Smith’s client or customer. Pimlico Plumbers arrives at a time when the Courts are favouring worker-protective outcomes. Cases such as Windle, and Aslam &amp; Farrar v Uber (2202550/2015) have incrementally played a clarificatory role in the status of a “worker”. Hence, Pimlico Plumbers is uncontroversial in the sense that whether Mr Smith was a “worker” under section 230(3)(b) of the ERA was always a question of fact for the tribunal. However, what will be of interest (especially to the gig economy) is that section 230(3)(b) now means that independent contractors or those engaged in ‘self-employed’ contracts are capable of being recognised as “workers” and can benefit from the legal rights arising from that recognition.  Pimlico Plumbers also raises other issues concerning the compatibility between worker status and self-employment under tax law, but this is a question to be answered at another time.

    "title": "The Standard Bank Plc Deferred Prosecution Agreement",
    "body": "2016/03/06 - Dear Editor,The UK’s first deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) was made at the end of last year. After extensive negotiations in an African bribery case, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) agreed terms with Standard Bank Plc for the payment of a significant financial penalty and Lord Justice Leveson, sitting as a Judge of the Crown Court at Southwark, gave judgement confirming that the settlement served the public interest in the particular circumstances of the case. 1 Under a DPA, criminal proceedings are instituted against a company but then they are immediately suspended under the condition that the company pays a significant financial penalty and implements a corporate compliance programme. When these conditions have been satisfied, the criminal proceedings are discontinued and the company avoids a criminal conviction against its name. DPAs have been popular tools for resolving cases involving corporate criminal activity in the US, and after much consideration section 45 and schedule 17 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 were enacted to enable this type of agreement to be made in the UK. However, opinions are sharply divided regarding the place of DPAs in the criminal justice system. For some, DPAs represent ‘a corrupt law enforcement regime which threatens a loss of respect for the rule of law’. 2 But for others DPAs offer an elegant solution by which the criminal justice system can respond to corporate misconduct within a positive framework that encourages improvements according to the standards of corporate governance. As an editorial in The Times recently pointed out,3 DPAs can help the SFO’s enforcement policy become more “muscular” by sparing the expense of a full criminal investigation and the possibility of a humiliating acquittal if prosecution is pursued through the criminal courts. It is easy for critics to call for more pro-active corporate prosecutions in the UK through the criminal courts, but obtaining criminal convictions for substantive offences, particularly in cases involving allegations of bribery and corruption, is not easy as a result of the continuing adherence to the corporate identification or corporate attribution rule. This rule provides that a company cannot be guilty of a criminal offence unless it can be shown beyond reasonable doubt that a director or senior officer who represented ‘the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation’ was involved in the offending conduct (Lennard’s Carrying Co v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd). 4 In the modern age of monolithic companies with cross-border operations, it is often difficult if not impossible for the SFO to obtain probative evidence to this effect. The facts in R v Standard Bank Plc reflect a case in point. In September 2012, Standard Bank (a UK regulated bank) together with its subsidiary bank Stanbic Bank Tanzania Ltd (a Tanzanian company based in Dar es Salaam) agreed with the Tanzanian Government to raise funds for its five-year development plan. The agreement provided that one per cent of the fee payable to Standard Bank amounting to $6 million would be remitted to a local partner in Tanzania called Enterprise Growth Market Advisors Limited (EGMA). EGMA’s directors and shareholders were senior figures in the Tanzanian Government, and there was a clear inference that the purpose of the payment was to encourage these figures to use their influence to persuade the Tanzanian Government into making the agreement with Standard Bank and its subsidiary company. Two senior members of Stanbic Bank based in Tanzania, who must have appreciated that EGMA had no role to play in the financing agreement, negotiated the agreement. However, before proceeding to make the agreement Standard Bank omitted to conduct any due diligence enquiries on the local partner company, believing it was not necessary in the circumstances. Plainly, on any view, this was a massive error of judgment by Standard Bank. In any event, after Stanbic Bank paid $6 million to EGMA, employees at Stanbic Bank raised concerns about the propriety of the payment. These concerns were relayed to Standard Bank and following an initial investigation Standard Bank self-reported its preliminary findings to the SFO. As the DPA recognised, the evidence pointed towards a breach of section 7(1) of the Bribery Act 2010, with an indictment alleging that Standard Bank had failed to prevent persons associated with the bank, namely Stanbic Bank and the negotiators, from committing bribery. The evidence also suggested that Standard Bank would experience difficulty in any attempt to establish the statutory defence in section 7(2) of the Bribery Act 2010, which would require Standard Bank to have adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with the Bank from committing bribery. The upshot was that Standard Bank agreed to pay compensation to the Tanzanian Government of $6 million plus interest, disgorge its profit on the agreement of $8. 4 million and pay a financial penalty of $16 million. As well as avoiding prosecution and possible criminal conviction by making the DPA, Standard Bank was able to avoid acceptance of any liability for committing a substantive bribery offence. A criminal conviction establishing that a Standard Bank employee had assisted in the commission of a bribery offence would have been very damaging in reputational terms, and the Bank’s future profitability would have been adversely affected. Instead, as Lord Justice Leveson’s judgment makes clear, there was no allegation against Standard Bank of knowing participation in an offence of bribery, and the offence was limited to an allegation of inadequate systems to prevent associated persons from committing an offence of bribery. 5 In truth, the SFO was hamstrung. As Lord Justice Leveson explained: ‘The SFO has reached the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that any of Standard Bank’s employees committed an offence: whilst a payment of $6 million was made available to EGMNA, the evidence does not demonstrate with the appropriate cogency that anyone within Standard Bank knew that two senior executives of Stanbic intended the payment to constitute a bribe, or so intended it themselves’. 6 At this point, it is interesting to bear in mind the response of the Tanzanian authorities to the corruption investigation. Apparently, according to the information contained in Lord Justice Leveson’s judgment, the authorities in Tanzania had been informed of the DPA and did not make any objection to it. In fact, the Judge observed, the Tanzanian authorities were supportive of the settlement and have done nothing to undermine it. This is faint praise indeed. But it is less than helpful from the SFO’s perspective since if an effective case of bribery were to be mounted against Standard Bank, the negotiators in Stanbic Bank or the EGMA directors, key evidence from Tanzania would be required. It is possible to show transfers of money between accounts on the face of banking documents, but this is often an arid exercise, especially where it is not entirely clear why a particular transfer has been made. As the lawyer Billy Flynn explains to the Judge in the musical Chicago when Velma Kelly takes the stand, if a criminal case is going to be successful a jury needs to be told a story – some of the ‘old razzle dazzle’. And it is difficult to tell a story without any of the key witnesses attending trial to give evidence. Against this background, whilst the DPA made between the SFO and Standard Bank may not represent a perfect resolution, unquestionably the outcome is better than nothing. Apart from anything else, it enables the SFO to send out a message that Africa’s largest bank is not immune from criminal process in the UK, and if it wants to keep out of trouble in the future it needs to raise its standards of corporate governance. Whatever the critics may say, this is definitely a step towards the right direction.

    "title": "What can legal academics add to the debate about private equity?",
    "body": "2016/03/01 - Dear Editor, In December 2015, Unite – Britain’s largest trade union – called on the UK government to investigate the ‘secretive machinations of private equity firms’ following the near-collapse of Fairline Boats, a Northamptonshire yacht-builder employing well over 400 people. 1 Unite’s demands were not new: as the economic influence of private equity firms has increased in Europe over the last few decades, so have the calls from unions, politicians and the media for regulators to intervene. But it is not entirely clear what private equity’s critics want the regulators to do. More transparency perhaps? Voluntary guidelines – adopted in 2007 by the UK’s private equity trade association, the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA) – already mandate listed company-like disclosures for the largest private equity-owned companies,2 but for smaller businesses (like Fairline Boats) it is far from obvious why companies owned by private equity should be treated any differently to any other privately-owned company, all of whom are already subject to statutory public disclosures. Meanwhile, private equity’s critics in the UK and, probably more importantly, other parts of Europe, have given impetus to the European Commission who, as part of its response to the financial crisis, introduced far reaching EU-wide regulation of the ‘alternative investment funds’ industry. 3 Taking up the cause of transparency, the Commission required greater disclosure by buyout houses taking over larger EU companies, and outlawed some types of ‘asset stripping’ in the two years following the acquisition. 4 How effective these changes turn out to be, remains to be seen, but there certainly does not seem to have been much background work by policy-makers to justify the new rules or assess their impact. That may not be surprising, given the perceived need for ‘quick fixes’ after the Financial Crisis (even though there was no convincing evidence that private equity played any part in causing the crisis, or adding to the systemic risks which exacerbated it).   But it is also notable that regulators had little home-grown corporate governance law scholarship to draw upon in designing their regulatory response. 5 It is true that there is considerable research on the economic impact of private equity, including from the LSE’s own Abraaj Group Professor in Finance and Private Equity, Ulf Axelson. 6 On the whole, academics have concluded that private equity-backed companies are more efficient than their publicly listed counterparts, and perhaps also than their privately-owned peers. 7 Their impact on wages and employment remains somewhat controversial, although there is no convincing academic support for the short-term asset stripping accusations often levelled at the industry. 8 However, industry-wide quantitative performance studies, though important, are not going to give the full picture, and the effect that private equity firms have on governance structures is under-researched, especially in relation to the mechanisms behind the ‘machinations’ that determine decisions for stakeholders. More research in this area is vital, because policy-makers have to design regulation with the benefit of evidence-based theoretical models.   But corporate governance scholars, at least in the legal academy, have spent much more time thinking about widely-held companies than they have about those which are closely-held.   That is understandable (and presents a very worthwhile and interesting research topic), but we need to help policy-makers think about private companies – including fairly small ones. As anyone who has taken an undergraduate course in company law will know, most academic theories of corporate governance focus on ‘agency costs’: the temptation to ‘steal’ or ‘shirk’ when (in Adam Smiths’ terms)9 one person is charged with looking after another’s money. 10 However, many academics accept that, when stakeholders have good and reasonably symmetric access to information and the right incentives, they will bargain for optimal terms, mitigating (although probably not eliminating) the agency costs implicit in the delegation of power. 11 It is also commonly argued (although by no means universally accepted)12 that the most efficient companies will be created when shareholders are the ultimate beneficiaries of the efforts of those in charge, and (if they are equipped to do so) are allowed to bargain freely for the agency-cost mitigating structures which suit them best. 13 However, the UK’s corporate governance framework, especially as it applies to private companies, is muddled.   On the one hand, it pays attention to the ‘freedom to contract’ paradigm implied by the theory described above; but it is also peppered with apparently mandatory rules. 14 It is not always clear who these rules are designed to protect, and many of them turn out to be contractible in any event. 15 Justifications for mandatory rules in widely-held companies may not apply to closely-held companies, with the consequence that designing optimal corporate governance frameworks in this environment may be more costly than it needs to be, and efficient outcomes may be thwarted. On the other hand, if there is a case for mandatory rules designed to protect other stakeholders who do not have a seat at the table when private company constitutions are written, that case needs to be articulated on a sound theoretical footing.   If the case is made, the mandatory rules which it implies will, no doubt, be quite different to the ones we have.   But if that case fails, it certainly does not undermine the case for protecting those stakeholders in other ways: through, for example, enhanced employment protection rights, or tougher regulations prohibiting pollution or other actions giving rise to externalities which rational shareholders would not internalise.   That is, after all, the more usual way in which we protect third parties. In the end Fairline Boats (now renamed Fairline Yachts) seems to have been saved,16 although with significant job losses.   That may or may not have been the best available outcome for society at large, but it is not clear what legal changes, if any, could have led to a better one.   If any part of the answer to that question lies with the UK’s corporate governance laws (and, perhaps just as importantly, if it does not), then legal academics should step up to the plate.

    "title": "A Right to 'Truth' on the War on Terror",
    "body": "2016/02/02 - Dear Editor,One of the most disturbing features of the “War on Terror” is Guantanamo Bay. At the end of October 2015, Shaker Aamer, the last UK citizen detained there, was finally released and allowed to reunite with his family, after 14 years of incarceration without charge. As a lawyer committed to the principle of the rule of law and the protection of human rights through the UK and European court systems, I wondered how long it would be before Mr Aamer took legal action against the UK Government for complicity in his torture. We’ve already seen several cases at the European Court of Human Rights regarding British violations in the Iraq war. For example, in Al-Skeini, 1it was alleged that five Iraqi citizens were killed by British troops in the UK-occupied Basra; the sixth victim was arrested by British troops and taken to a UK detention facility where he was allegedly mistreated and killed. In Al-Jedda, 2 the applicant was detained at a British-run detention facility in Iraq for over 18 months. It seemed only natural to me that, having suffered so much and for so long, Shaker Aamer would also wish to take legal action against the UK government, in the same way that others have in the past. I was surprised, therefore, when Shaker Aamer announced that he would not take legal action against the UK government. He said during an interview with the BBC, “I do not want to prosecute anybody. I do not want anybody to be asked about what his role [was] in the past. I just want people to tell the truth. ” 3 The right to the truth is not something contained in the UK Human Rights Act 1998, nor in the European Convention on Human Rights. Yet there is something very human, basic and powerful about simply wanting to know “the truth”. Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions have been more forthcoming in engaging with this concept before. The “Cotton Fields” case, 4 heard by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2009, ruled on Mexico’s alleged responsibility for the disappearance and subsequent death of three women, whose bodies were found in a cotton field in Mexico. The Court found that “the absence of a complete and effective investigation into the facts constitutes a source of additional suffering and anguish for the victims, who have the right to know the truth about what happened. This right to the truth requires the determination of the most complete historical truth possible, which includes determination of the collective patterns of action, and of all those who, in different ways, took part in said violations. ” 5 The Court then ordered Mexico to effectively conduct the criminal proceedings that were underway as well as, inter alia, to remove barriers to the investigation of the facts and to publish the results of the proceedings, “so that Mexican society is aware of the facts that are the purpose of the instant case. ”6 At the UN level, the right to truth has also been recognised. In 2008, the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 9/11, in which it requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a comprehensive study on best practices for the effective implementation of the right to the truth. 7 In September 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 18/7, by which it appointed a Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence for a period of three years. 8 This was extended for a further three years in 2014. The relationship between truth and justice seems to be a natural one, and as we have seen, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the United Nations had explicitly endorsed this concept. As such, one way of looking at Shaker Aamer’s decision not to take legal action is that victims of human rights abuses don’t feel that the UK courts and possibly also European courts are an appropriate vehicle for addressing their grievances. Whilst legal action inevitably involves establishing facts as a way of understanding what happened, the extent to which this process enables “the determination of the complete historical truth” and the “determination of the collective patterns of action, and of all those who, in different ways, took part in… violations” is questionable, especially where one of the parties is the Government. 9 Within the UK jurisdiction and on the European level, there seems to be a tendency to use monetary compensation as the mechanism for achieving justice. However, the understanding of “the truth” is clearly as important to victims of human rights abuses, as evidenced by Shaker Aamer. Similarly, in the Belhaj case, concerning the alleged involvement of UK State agents and agencies in the unlawful detention and mistreatment of two Libyan nationals, the claimants only sought £1 each from the defendants but insisted on the UK government unequivocally admitting its liability. 10 Therefore, perhaps courts at the domestic and regional level in Europe could take some lessons from other jurisdictions, where the desire for people to “tell the truth” and for that “truth” to be made public is recognised and embedded within the legal setting.

    "title": "UK/EU Referendum: Are there alternatives to Membership?",
    "body": "2016/01/26 - Dear Editor,Within the next few months, the UK electorate will have to decide on the UK’s relationship with the EU. In February, the Heads of State of the EU Member States will discuss to what extent Cameron’s demands can be accommodated in a new settlement. In June (probably) the renewed relationship between the UK and the EU shall be put to the UK electorate in a yes/no referendum. This timing already suggests that Treaty change (i. e. to the TFEU) is out of the order – 4 months is nowhere long enough for 28 national parliaments to ratify the changes, and the Member States that are so constitutionally required to hold a referendum (even presuming that they all agree with the new compromise). It seems that any reforms would have to be legally enshrined as changes to secondary legislation. Such changes, however, require the consent of the European Commission and the European Parliament, which is difficult to be secured given their general pro-integration stance. It will remain to be seen to what extent Cameron’s demands can, and will, be accommodated by his European partners. Whichever settlement is agreed in Brussels in February, it will be for the British electorate to decide on its merits. This letter aims to briefly set out the alternatives to British membership in the EU, so as to inform this decision. If the British electorate votes ‘no’, and the UK leaves the EU, we can think of three possible scenarios for the relationship between the UK and the EU. It seems that the main objective of any new relationship would revolve around securing access to the EU’s internal market (crucial for many British industries, and particularly for the City of London), without having to follow the rules of Brussels that are perceived as problematic (free movement of persons, migration, budget, social policy etc). This first option could be called the ‘Norwegian option’. Norway is not a EU Member State, but does have access to the internal market. Like Liechtenstein and Iceland, it is part of the European Economic Area. If the UK were to leave the EU and join the EEA, it would secure access to the internal market (but the UK would also have to accept related rules, such as free movement of workers, citizens, social policy, and some budgetary commitments). This option does not allow for any individual negotiation between the UK and the EU, and would consist of the UK joining a pre-existing arrangement. The main problem with this approach is not only its lack of specificity, but also that the EEA states are policy-takers, not policy-makers. They cannot participate in the law-making process of the EU, but they have to follow the rules made by the EU institutions. This, naturally, generates significant democratic problems. This is less problematic for countries such as Iceland or Norway, which would not necessarily have much of a say either way. The second option is the ‘Swiss option’. The relationship between Switzerland and the EU is a bi-lateral international agreement. This approach has the main advantage that it can be tailored specifically to the needs of the UK and the EU, both in relation to the policy areas covered, the applicable rules, the institutional arrangements and the legal instruments that apply. In the Swiss case, there are a number of policy areas covered (namely free movement, access to the internal market, Schengen), and there is no requirement to implement new EU norms. This latter rule allows the Swiss Parliament to decide which new EU rules to implement and which not to. In reality, however, empirical research suggests that the Swiss Parliament over-implements new EU norms, out of the fear that – if Swiss national rules do not follow new EU market norms – Swiss companies will not be able to access the single market. In addition, the Swiss-EU bi-laterals contain a so-called ‘guillotine clause’, whereby in case one of the provisions is breached by either of the parties, the other party can suspend all agreements. This has led to a situation whereby the hands of the Swiss Parliament and electorate are tied by the initial agreement with the EU. The terms of that initial agreement, of course, to a large extent depend on the relative strength of the negotiation positions of the EU and the UK. It is obvious that the former is in a much stronger negotiation position, and it therefore seems very unlikely that the ‘Swiss scenario’ will lead to a significantly better relationship between the EU and the UK from the British perspective. Access to the single market while limiting migration; a lower budget transfer to Brussels but a veto on sensitive issues; limiting social rights legislation while pushing for liberalization of the services industries – such scenarios are simply unrealistic in a bi-lateral negotiation process that has to be ratified by each of the 27 remaining EU Member States. The third possibility is not having any specific agreement with the EU. The UK would be like the US, Uruguay or Uzbekistan. Its relationship with the EU would be covered by international agreements (such as the WTO) or a specific trade partnership (such as the currently negotiated TTIP). This option has the advantage of simplifying things: Westminster decides on everything – Brussels has no say on anything. A radical split from the EU may enhance democratic and civic engagement in the UK. Unfortunately, this solution seems to have some big disadvantages. First, the UK would lose free access to the internal market, meaning custom duties for some of its producers, and the possibility of companies in the City re-establishing themselves in Luxembourg, Frankfurt or Paris, where they can access the single market. More structurally, even non-EU Member States de facto abide by some of the rules of the EU. This is known as the ‘Brussels effect’, and suggests that in certain policy domains (such as privacy, competition law, chemicals regulation or product safety), EU law has extra-territorial effect. An example might clarify this process. The privacy settings of users of Facebook, an American company, are regulated by different legislators in different countries. The EU’s level of regulation, however, is the most protective of privacy of its users. Facebook, wanting to access the EU’s market of 500 million users, will have to abide by those standards, and, given the technical indivisibility of privacy settings, will set its global privacy settings to the level of the EU. In other words, in many regulatory areas, EU law applies globally. The capacity of the UK to influence these norms (rather than simply follow them), therefore, seems to require it to be an insider to the EU’s policy making. These three scenarios present challenges to the relationship between the EU and the UK that are as least as problematic as the reform process itself. It suggests that, given the proximity of the UK to the EU’s borders and market, the UK can never be fully free from the influence of the EU. The main question is: How can the UK’s interest be best protected – as an insider or outsider to the process? Yours,Floris de WitteAssistant Professor of Law LSE "

                var time = Math.ceil("IntroductionCan individuals infected with COVID-19 sue those who unintentionally transmitted the novel coronavirus to them? This article explores the effectiveness of using the tort of negligence as a legal tool to reduce the spread of COVID-19.1 In particular, there exists a wide duty of care upon each individual towards another’s physical well-being not to transmit the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – the cause of the highly infectious COVID-19 disease that transpired into a global pandemic.2 Considerations for the reasonableness of departing from the orthodox approach on duty of care derived from other commutable diseases are informed by the novel features of COVID-19, and possible perverse incentives not to seek early testing if the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 is defined too narrowly. Having established this duty of care, the argument then considers using a proportionality test to assess the standard of care, balancing individual autonomy against public health considerations, the value of which would be to limit this tortious liability in practice. Lastly, this article further explores the potential difficulties in proving causation and proposes to adopt the Bonnington test based on material contribution to cumulative physical injuries. Notwithstanding the paucity of case law related to COVID-19, this article conducts a comparative analysis with the current literature related to the transmission of other types of viral diseases, particularly the deadly Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In the meantime, it shall be noted from the outset that discussion related to the possible use of strict liability regime or intentional torts to control the spread of COVID-19 (which could even become subjects of criminal prosecution) are beyond the scope of this article.  Duty of Care The rationale underlying the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 shall first be assessed under the common law’s two models of tort, namely the Model of Wrongs and the Model of Costs. Under the Model of Wrongs3, corollary to an individual’s right to physical health is another’s duty to respect the other person’s state of natural health. Such a duty gives rise to a standard of conduct in relation to COVID-19 transmission (discussed later in this article), to which failure to comply results a wrong being committed. In justifying this duty, Ripstein’s conception of mutual independence4, and thus the duty not to take charge of others’ means, would see a duty incumbent upon each individual not to conduct him/herself in a way that negligently transmits COVID-19 to the harm of another’s body.In comparison, Calabresi’s Model of Costs5 would seek to allocate the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 upon the party “best placed” to decide on the most efficient way of minimising costs related to COVID-19 transmission. Here, a potentially COVID-19-infectious individual is arguably the “best decider” of his or her own risk of COVID-19 transmission and the associated costs of taking precaution against such transmission. Indeed, a caveat is attached to the word “arguably” because the state might be the “better decider” than potentially COVID-19-infectious individuals, if, for example, a majority of the population unduly under-estimates the severity of COVID-19. This might furnish sufficient grounds for the state to intervene by introducing relevant regulations to manage COVID-19 transmissions.6.= Nevertheless, a legislative debate is beyond the purview of this article; and for present purpose, it is sufficient to see potentially COVID-19-infectious individuals being at least the “better decider” vis-à-vis COVID-19 victims, thus placing on the former the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 under a liability regime. In this respect, both the Model of Wrongs and the Model of Costs could be used to understand the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19, albeit from different perspectives. In fact, the Calabresi “best-decider” Model of Costs also sheds light on who should potentially become amendable to the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19. Understandably, a potentially COVID-19-infectious individual has better knowledge of his or her own social interaction history than COVID-19 victims. This superior knowledge thus puts a potentially COVID-19-infectious individual in a better position vis-à-vis a COVID-19 victim to decide how COVID-19 transmission from him/herself should best be reduced. This reasoning not only forms the basis of the duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19, but also explains established duties of care not to negligently transmit other types of commutable diseases. This is in line with other common law jurisdictions (particularly US jurisdictions) that have engaged the issue of disease transmission using tort liability regimes. For example, in Hendricks v. Butcher7, the Missouri Court of Appeal established a duty of care for those with smallpox virus not to spread their infection; in Berner v. Caldwell8, the Supreme Court of Alabama also imposed a duty on individuals infected with herpes to protect his or her sexual partners from infection. Nevertheless, the different symptoms and modes of transmission of smallpox, herpes, and COVID-19 could mean that the scope of tort liability would be different for each disease. The characteristic skin sores on smallpox patients9, and the transmission of herpes through sexual activities10, imply that those who do not demonstrate the relevant smallpox symptoms, or those who do not engage in the relevant sexual activities, would not need to bear any duties as the “best decider”  – because there exist no costs to minimise in the first place. In contrast, the air-borne capability of SARS-CoV-211 and the asymptomatic spread of COVID-1912 could make everyone potentially infectious. As the UK Coronavirus Act 2020, Schedule 21 Part 1 Section 2(1) aptly provides: a person is “potentially infectious” at any time if: a)    the person is, or may be, infected or contaminated with coronavirus, and there is a risk that the person might infect or contaminate others with coronavirus, orb)    the person has been in an infected area within the 14 days preceding that time.13At the time of this writing, COVID-19 has spread across 213 countries and territories across the globe.14 It is therefore safe to say that any travellers entering the UK would qualify as “potentially infectious” by virtue of Section 2(1)(b) for being within an area reported to have coronavirus within the preceding 14 days. However, it is also worth noting that Section 2(1) only refers to countries, territories, and areas outside the UK.15 Nevertheless, given that the UK itself ranks the 14th globally for the greatest number of COVID-19 cases at the time of this writing16, the territories that shall be deemed as “potentially infectious”, for the normative purpose of this article, shall be understood to also include the UK.Arguably, such a wide duty of care might seem to undermine the principle of minimum intervention and individual autonomy. However, defining the scope of tort liability surrounding COVID-19 based on the traditional jurisprudence of other types of viral diseases would be guilty of ignoring the novel features of COVID-19 discussed above. In addition, there also exist public policy grounds that would make a wide-ranging duty not to negligently transmit COVID-19 compatible with the “fair, just, reasonable” requirement of the Caparo test.17 At the time of this writing, testing facilities for COVID-19 are still not readily accessible in many parts of the world18, and suspected patients cannot get their test results immediately after taking the diagnostic test.19 This potential double delay in both getting a test and getting the result of a test, coupled with the highly commutable nature of SARS-CoV-2,20 would result in considerable virus leak within the community between the time the suspected patient seeks to access a test and the time the patient is confirmed as a positive case of COVID-19. Such virus leak and the consequent build-up of yet-to-confirm COVID-19 patients would result in further delay in receiving test results, if the testing capacity of the locality did not expand at a rate commensurate with the infection rate. This consequently sets up a vicious cycle in which further virus leak is perpetuated within the larger community. Additionally, if the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 is only limited to those individuals who received positive results from their COVID-19 tests, this would, on the contrary, create perverse incentives for people not to seek testing at an early stage. If individuals fear that they may have COVID-19 and the test results transpired to be positive, they can readily face liability in negligence if the virus was indeed transmitted to others. Instead, the claimants would not be able to establish a duty to act if people do not take COVID-19 tests and are therefore ignorant of their diseases. Although the doctrine of wilful blindness21 may capture those defendants who deliberately close their minds to further inquiries in fear of validating their suspicion, this doctrine is nonetheless only effective in exceptional cases when the possibility of being COVID-19-positive is obvious. However, asymptomatic spread is what has made COVID-19 so hard to control, thus making early-stage testing and speedy diagnosis even more important than for other types of viral diseases. Undoubtedly, such perverse incentive would be dangerous from a public health perspective. If potentially infectious individuals are unaware that they are carriers of SARS-CoV-2, they might unknowingly transmit the virus to others through subsequent social encounters, spreading the virus exponentially to the greater community. Therefore, in view of the novel features of COVID-19 and the above analysis on the dire public health consequences on limiting the duty of care only to confirmed COVID-19 patients, there is indeed a case to depart from the conventional duty of care established in the jurisprudence of other commutable diseases. Considerations for the extent of the negligence liability related to COVID-19 transmission would be assessed through careful calibration of the standard of care, which would be discussed below.Standard of CareAccording to Bolton v. Stone22, a defendant is not negligent if the risk of foreseeable damage is small and the cost of taking precaution is disproportionately high. In the context of COVID-19, this involves balancing the reasonably perceived risk of transmitting COVID-19 against the cost of taking preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Various preventive measures could attract different degrees of cost on an individual’s autonomy, ranging from comparatively small inconvenience such as social distancing for a certain radius, or wearing a mask, goggles, or a face shield, to comparatively greater limitation on one’s movement such as self-isolation or quarantine. Similarly, for corporate entities, there is also a spectrum of costs related to taking various preventive measures, ranging from the provision of sanitising and protective equipment, enhanced cleaning regimes, and reduced business capacity for social-distancing measures, to ultimate shut-down of business. What specific preventive measures that each individual (or corporate entity) has to take – and consequently what degrees of cost that each individual (or corporate entity) has to bear – in discharge of their duty of care would depend on a reasonable perception of both the consequences and the risks of COVID-19 transmission in individual circumstances. In this regard, in assessing how much individual autonomy should be compromised, this article proposes a proportionality test in determining the standard of care, balancing the cost of taking preventive measures against both the consequences and the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others. However, in applying this proportionality test, even in the jurisprudence of other commutable diseases, there is no clear line regarding how substantial a risk must be before the defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence. In the case of HIV infections (decided in the tort law context), in Mussivand v. David23, the Ohio Supreme Court held that “a person who knows, or should know, that he or she is infected with a venereal disease has the duty to abstain from sexual conduct or, at a minimum, to warn those persons with whom he or she expects to have sexual relations of his or her condition”. In Doe v. Roe24, the New York Court of Appeal stated that the use of a condom may even shield defendants from negligence liability. Similarly, the Law Commission of England and Wales25 even considered whether disclosure of disease status is still required when the risk of STD transmission is low, either because the infected person used a condom, or was undergoing antiretroviral treatment. All these have shown that even infected individuals may nonetheless be deemed to have exercised an acceptable level of care without having to refrain from sexual activities. Despite the differences between STD and COVID-19 discussed in the previous section, both viral diseases are at least commutable among humans and preventive measures including wearing a condom (in the case of STD) and wearing a mask (in the case of COVID-19) are preventive measures aimed to significantly reduce, though not to eradicate, transmission. This is in line with the Learned Hand test26 under the Model of Costs (and indeed the reasoning behind Bolton v. Stone 27 which requires precautions to be taken only if the statistical multiple of the probability and the consequence of harm is cost-effective. Both sexual activities (in the case of STD transmission) and social interactions (in the case of COVID-19 transmission) are fundamentally desirable activities that the law does not discourage – but only if carried out in a cost-efficient way. Therefore, in the context of COVID-19, a potentially infectious individual may not necessarily have to go to the extent of undergoing self-isolation to discharge the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 – mask-wearing is likely to be sufficient in ordinary circumstances. Having said so, it must be noted that Calabresi’s Model of Costs28 also requires individuals to consider the consequences of transmission.29 Specifically, in view of the higher risk of severe COVID-19 for older adults30 and people with underlying health conditions31, potentially infectious individuals need to exercise greater care than simply wearing masks in order to discharge their duty of care. Ignorance of these special circumstances, where greater care is required to prevent COVID-19 transmission to individuals at increased risks, is unlikely to succeed as a defence, in view of the wide-spread media coverage of COVID-19 and its related specialty risks.In the meantime, it is also impossible to ignore the strength of the counterargument based on individual autonomy, which finds its support in the jurisprudence of other types of viral diseases. In the context of STD, both Weait32 and Cherkassky 33 have argued that everyone has a responsibility to minimise the transmission of STD and people who do not ask their partners whether or not they are infected should be responsible for failing to protect their own health. With due respect, this argument still does not attenuate the defendants’ liability for engaging in acts that they knew to be potentially harmful and indeed had harmed others.34 In fact, allowance has already been made to defendants’ autonomy by allowing consent to be used as a justificatory defence. In this regard, informed consent by the victim should be seen as the ultimate acknowledgement that defendants had done what they could reasonably be expected to do in the circumstances to protect victims from potential harm. Having said so, applying the doctrine of informed consent to COVID-19 would produce bizarre and economically costly results in everyday interactions. For one thing, a person who is aware or suspects that she is a carrier of COVID-19 would need to seek everyone’s consent before she could board the Tube. This is clearly not viable in practice.  As an alternative to informed consent, the operation of implied consent35 presumes that riders of public transport have consented to the risk of contracting COVID-19 when they boarded the crowded Tube – either because they perceive the consequence of infection as not serious enough or the risk of infection as an obvious and acceptable fact. Therefore, wearing a mask is seemingly not a matter of fulfilling one’s duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 to others, but rather a measure of self-protection adopted by individuals who do not wish to be taken as impliedly consented to the risk of contracting COVID-19 when moving around in public. A corollary of this argument is that any preventive measures mentioned in this section shall only be adopted on a voluntary basis and must not be mandated. Indeed, as in the context of STD, risk taking, whether or not related to disease transmission, had always been a feature of consensual sexual activities, which society had not sought to intervene in the past. Such an argument based on individual autonomy and the doctrine of implied consent relies on the important assumption that potential victims are fully aware of the actual risks of infection. However, this is simply not true in the context of COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 does not express distinct physical manifestations, individuals cannot be presumed to know that the person standing next to him/her is a carrier of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, consent to interacting with others in public cannot be presumed as consent to contracting COVID-19 in law. In fact, if victims are presumed to appreciate the risk of COVID-19 in any social encounters, there would exist no basis for liability of disease transmission based on fraudulent misrepresentation. This is because there cannot exist any deception to the risk of transmission in the first place if individuals are expected and presumed to know such risk themselves. As such, the presumption that victims would always be aware of the risk of transmission is a dangerous fantasy, which could render moot the liability for disease transmission through deception and risk failing to protect the most vulnerable victims. In essence, neither informed consent nor implied consent based on considerations for individual autonomy is tenable in the context of COVID-19. In law, taking preventive measures such as wearing a mask is not a matter of individual risk-assessment under the doctrine of implied consent, but a means of discharging the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 under the tort of negligence. Consideration for individual autonomy is nonetheless incorporated in the proportionality test assessing the standard of care.  Causation In practice, causation might be the biggest hurdle in establishing liability for negligently transmitting COVID-19. At the time of this writing, SARS-CoV-2 is known to be capable of being transmitted through aerosols36 and fomites.37 This makes it costly, if not impossible, in practice to determine which particular droplet of SARS-CoV-2 had infected the victim. A patient might already have inhaled a non-tortious airborne nucleus of SARS-CoV-2 before contracting the droplet of SARS-CoV-2 from the negligent defendant. Therefore, the orthodox route in establishing causation through the Barnett 38 ’but-for’39 test is hard to satisfy in the context of COVID-19.40Nevertheless, in Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw41 , the court had assisted claimants to overcome this evidential gap by finding causation in situations where it could be shown that the tortious exposure to the silica dust had materially contributed to the claimant’s harm, even if it was not the only cause. In the context of COVID-19, a research report published by the Lancet Infectious Disease Medical Journal on 1st June 2020 found that “(t)he mean viral load of severe (COVID-19) cases was around 60 times higher than that of mild cases”, with data indicating that “similar to SARS in 2002–03, patients with severe COVID-19 tend to have a high viral load and a long virus shedding period”.42 This finding not only suggests that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 might be a useful indicator for assessing COVID-19 severity and prognosis, but also indicates, importantly, that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms aggravates in cumulo with SARS-COV-2 load. Therefore, similar to Bonnington in which the incremental nature of the claimant’s pneumoconiosiswas attributable to the cumulative effect of both the tortious and non-tortious silica dust, the cumulative nature of COVID-19 symptoms also makes the disease incremental, in which the disease aggravates with each exposure and is thus a divisible injury in law. Consequently, causation could be established on the basis that the defendant’s breach of duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 had made a material contribution to the claimant’s disease, even if the claimant could have first contracted SARS-CoV-2 from a non-tortious source. Causation based on this cumulative effect of divisible diseases is highlighted by Lord Keith in Bonnington itself: Prima facie the particles inhaled are acting cumulatively, and I think the natural inference is that had it not been for the cumulative effect the pursuer would not have developed pneumoconiosis when he did and might not have developed it at all.43However, a further difficulty inherent in the “Bonnington causation” lies in the apportionment of damages. In the context of COVID-19, there has been no acceptable scientifically supported evidentiary basis on which concurrent inhalation of both tortious and non-tortious SARS-CoV-2 could be apportioned to individual sources (such was the situation in Thompson v Smiths Shiprepairers (North Shields) Ltd44, in which conventional apportionment could be carried out by the court because the causal factors of the claimant’s injury operated consecutively rather than concurrently). This has consequently resulted in a dilemma whereby diseases like COVID-19 are divisible in theory but indivisible in reality.45 In this regard, given that English courts have well-established that apportionment of damages is not applicable to cases in which the defendant had materially contributed to indivisible injuries 46, this article therefore sees no prospect of any apportionment of damages in COVID-19 situations where practical apportionment is not feasible.47 In other words, from both the defendant’s and the claimant’s perspective, assessment of damages for theoretically divisible yet practically indivisible diseases like COVID-19 is in no way different from diseases that are purely indivisible, both in law and in practice. Therefore, until science could advance to a point at which the cumulative nature of COVID-19 could be separated according to the progressive severity of COVID-19 symptoms in response to each successive exposure factor, a defendant who negligently transmits COVID-19 to another, absent mitigating circumstances (e.g. the claimant’s own contributory negligence), would have to bear damages to the full extent of loss endured by the claimant. Conclusion This article has explored the potential of using the tort of negligence to establish civil liability in relation to the unintentional transmission of COVID-19. Departing from the conventional jurisprudence of other types of viral diseases, this article has argued for imposing a wide-ranging duty of care not to transmit COVID-19 on anyone who is “potentially infectious”. Nevertheless, it aims to calibrate the extent of such negligence liability through a proportionality test at the standard of care stage, balancing consideration for public health against the law’s commitment for individual autonomy. Importantly, neither the doctrine of informed consent nor that of implied consent can operate realistically in the context of COVID-19. And mask-wearing is not a measure of individual risk assessment, but rather a means of discharging the aforementioned duty of care. Lastly, although causation could be proved based on the Bonnington test of material contribution to the claimant’s disease, damages shall nonetheless be assessed without apportionment, given that COVID-19 is indivisible in practice despite being divisible by nature. Granted, the civil recourse theory48 of tort law does not imagine every COVID-19 victim to exercise their right of redress and seek the kind of legal recourse discussed in this article, save for the situations where wrongful deaths resulted from egregious instances of negligence. As a final note, the author wishes to highlight that in view of the dynamic development of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the standard of care will likely be constantly adapted in accordance with scientific development. New preventive measures, plausibly including vaccine acceptance amongst the population49, may influence what could potentially be deemed as acceptable in discharging the duty of care not to transmit COVID-19.I am grateful for the feedback provided by Dr. Jo Braithwaite and Prof. Emmanuel Voyiakis from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the anonymous editors of the LSE Law Review, on the early drafts of this article.Julius Chen Ma".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("It is safe to say that the claimants in Fearn v Tate Gallery1, owners of multi-million pound, highly exclusive London flats, are not among the neediest of those who have applied to human rights law for help. However, the decision of Mann J in the High Court,2 while focusing primarily on the tort of nuisance, did raise an issue under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) of considerable importance – horizontal effect3, and the development of the common law in accordance with human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).This piece will focus on this important issue, as it was dealt with on appeal by the Court of Appeal. As the Court dealt with the issue with relative brevity, focusing much of its analysis on the question of tort law outlined below, this piece will use the decision as a springboard for analysing more broadly the process by which horizontal effect is created under the HRA. In doing so, it will also serve as a response to a prior case note published on this forum, written by Thomas Yeon on the High Court decision in Fearn.4 Contrary to Yeon, who supports the High Court’s approach to the issue, this piece will argue that the approach of Mann J left a great deal to be desired, and that the decision of the Court of Appeal is to be commended, as a welcome reassertion of a preferable approach to horizontal effect under the HRA. Having first set out the distinction in approach between the two courts, it will argue that the approach of the Court of Appeal is preferable for two reasons. The first is that it is far more consistent with past authorities, including a number of well-known Supreme Court decisions on horizontal effect. The second is that it is also far more consistent with a more normative, but no less critical, element of HRA jurisprudence, best expressed as ‘keeping the powder dry’.Court of Appeal DecisionIn order to understand the importance of the Court of Appeal’s decision on the HRA point, it is necessary briefly to re-examine the approach taken by Mann J at first instance.The facts of the case are, in fact, relatively straightforward. The claimants resided in a block of flats on the south side of the River Thames known as ‘Neo Bankside’, much of which was built from large glass panels. The result of this was that visitors to the nearby Tate Modern viewing gallery had a near-unimpeded view into the flats, and, according to the claimants, frequently used binoculars to get a better view, or even took photos which later emerged on social media. At its barest, the question facing both courts was the same – whether the tort of nuisance is capable of covering ‘overlooking’, and if it is not, whether the HRA makes any difference to that conclusion. Mann J held that the tort did cover overlooking, finding enough in the seminal decision in Hunter v Canary Wharf5 to support his conclusion. However, at paragraph 170, he then went on to hold that, “if there were any doubt about that, then in my view, that doubt has been removed by the Human Rights Act 1998 and Article 8.” In essence, Mann J’s conclusion was that English tort law most likely already covered the facts before him, but that if he was wrong about that, Article 86 certainly covered them, and a combination of the two would produce the unassailable conclusion that the claimants had a good claim.7 This process, in Mann J’s view, was the correct approach to take when developing the common law in line with human rights claims, as courts must do in order to comply with their obligations under Section 6(3)(a) HRA.8The Court of Appeal disagreed on more or less every level, with the exception of the ultimate result. On the tort law question, the Court found that the “overwhelming weight of judicial authority” pointed against Mann J’s conclusion that English law covered ‘overlooking’.9 However, more importantly for present purposes, the Court of Appeal held that there were “a number of errors of principle” with the manner in which Mann J had approached the HRA question. They held that the correct manner in which to approach the obligations thrust upon a court by Section 6(3)(a) was a strict three-stage test: first asking if English law covers the situation, then if the ECHR covers it, then, finally, whether it is “appropriate” to extend English common law to cover the situation at hand.10 On the facts before them, the Court concluded that, while there was a mismatch between English law and the ECHR, it was not “appropriate” to extend the tort of negligence to remedy this, as to do so would “significantly distort the tort in some important respects.”11 Thus, although for dramatically different reasons, the claimants lost again.Consistency I: Past AuthoritiesThe problem with Mann J’s approach can be summarised very succinctly – he viewed Section 6(3)(a) as requiring him to use human rights arguments as a ‘top-up’, if the arguments under English law were not quite sufficient to get the claimants over the line and create a successful claim. Rather than viewing the English law question and the ECHR question independently, Mann J inelegantly conflated the two, holding that the arguments under Hunter had provided the claimants with a case that was almost watertight, and the remaining uncertainties could be mopped up by deploying Article 8.Yeon argues, in his piece, that this approach is the “correct and appropriately restrained” approach to take as regards the obligations of courts under Section 6(3)(a). In this section, it will be argued that, contrary to Yeon’s argument, this approach was totally inconsistent with past authorities, and that the Court of Appeal’s approach was correct.Yeon cites, as authority for what he calls the “correct and appropriately restrained judicial approach” of Mann J, the oft-quoted judgment of Baroness Hale in Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers.12 In particular, Yeon cites paragraph 132, in which Baroness Hale confirmed the developing interpretation of Section 6(3)(a), namely that it does not require courts to create any new causes of action between private parties, but instead to develop the common law compatibly with ECHR principles. The correctness of this approach is indisputable, but Yeon fails to appreciate that Campbell only assists so far with the question in Fearn. It stands for the principle that courts should confine themselves to developing the common law rather than remaking it, but Baroness Hale does not express any opinion on the specific approach a court should take when so doing. Thus, Campbell is certainly authority for the proposition that Mann J could not have simply applied Article 8 as if it were itself a tort, and should instead have considered incorporating the provisions of Article 8 into English law. However, it is not authority for anything as regards when or how this incorporation should take place. Put more straightforwardly, Campbell speaks only to the broad-brush approach courts should take in interpreting Section 6(3)(a), it does not deal with the specifics of doing so. More is therefore required to assess the validity of Mann J’s approach.Authority on the manner in which the obligation cited in Campbell should be implemented abounds. For clarity, it is important to distinguish this line of authority from that which Jonathan Morgan quite correctly terms ‘equivocal’ – “what the HRA requires of a court faced with a “horizontal” human rights claim” as a substantive matter is, indeed, somewhat unclear, but the procedure under which they should arrive at a determination of “what the HRA requires” is not.13 Perhaps the clearest example comes from the Supreme Court decision in A v BBC14, particularly paragraph 57 of Lord Reed’s judgment. There, the now President of the Supreme Court confirmed that, in the context of Section 6(3)(a), “the starting point” is always domestic law, in this case, the “domestic principle of open justice”. Only once this has been assessed, he went on to say, should the question of Convention rights emerge, and only then should “the capacity of the common law to develop”become relevant.15  On the facts of the case, Lord Reed was not required to go beyond the first of the three questions, holding the long-standing principle of open justice to be sufficient, but the decision is nonetheless important for its clarity as regards the process to be followed under Section 6(3)(a). It is clear that this approach is that taken by the Court of Appeal in Fearn, not by Mann J – the three questions must be strictly delineated, and it is impermissible to ‘top-up’ a domestic law argument with human rights considerations as a result.A can count itself as part of a long line of authority to this effect, with Lord Reed citing a seven-Justice Supreme Court to the same effect in Kennedy v Charity Commission16 as one example. Indeed, the incorrectness of Mann J’s approach was actually confirmed yet again by the Supreme Court on the very same morning that the Court of Appeal decision in Fearn was handed down, in R (Jalloh) v Home Secretary.17 In the very first paragraph of her judgment, Baroness Hale clarified her own words in Campbell, although this time in the context of Article 5 ECHR, and the tort of false imprisonment. With characteristic clarity, Baroness Hale wrote that “this case is about the meaning of imprisonment at common law and whether it should, or should not, now be aligned with the concept of deprivation of liberty in Article 5 of the ECHR”.It is crystal clear, therefore, that the approach taken by Mann J in Fearn was wrong as a matter of authority. To borrow the Court of Appeal’s phrase, “the overwhelming weight of judicial authority” falls in favour of the three-step approach they advocated, and against the ‘topping-up’ approach Mann J, perhaps unwittingly, applied. To the extent that Yeon suggested otherwise, his argument is untenable as a matter of basic precedent, and Campbell provides little more than umbrella-level guidance on a much more technical issue.Consistency II: Keeping the Powder DryYeon’s argument is not just untenable as a matter of precedent, however. It is submitted here that the reverse approach taken by the Court of Appeal is to be immeasurably preferred as the “correct and appropriately restrained judicial approach” more generally. By contrast, Mann J’s approach should, with respect, be cast away as potentially dangerous and unprincipled.This is so for three reasons, which can essentially be summarised as a failure to respect the utility of ‘keeping the powder dry’ – failure to respect the sheer power of the HRA, and the enormous value that is therefore inherent in only deploying it when necessary, and on some occasions, leaving domestic law to do its job.First and foremost, Mann J’s approach in Fearn stands firmly at odds with the approach taken to Section 6(3)(a) overall, aside from the question of strict precedent. The debate as to the proper interpretation of the Section has, since before it was enacted, been firmly bookended by two diametrically opposite positions. At one end is the view of Sir William Wade, who predicted that the Section could be immensely powerful.18 More specifically, his view was that the Section had the power to “transform” or outright “abolish” the common law. At the other end entirely is the view of, inter alia, Sir Richard Buxton, who argued, extrajudicially, that the proper role of human rights was to regulate the relationship between state and citizen, and that the Section should be read very narrowly to reflect this.19English law has settled firmly for a middle-ground between the two20 – Wade’s conception of post-HRA law is simply too extreme to have been what Parliament intended (or at the very least, a change as radical as effectively creating a tort of ‘breach of human rights’ would need language far more explicit than that present in Section 6(3)(a)). Buxton’s view, on the other hand, unnecessarily emasculates human rights law by shutting off its power from a vast swathe of legal disputes in which it could justifiably be of use, and in any case, presents a narrower view of the discipline than that to which the European Court of Human Rights subscribes.21 In striking this middle ground, English law has recognised the value of ‘keeping the powder dry’, by limiting the power of the HRA, and ensuring it is not over-applied. Mann J’s approach presents an application of Section 6(3)(a) that is far too close to Wade’s view. The idea that the ECHR can be used to ‘top-up’ or ‘fill in the gaps’ for slightly defective domestic common law arguments suggests the HRA has created a kind of human rights ‘background radiation’ – a general ether of powerful legal principle that judges can call upon at will to expand the reach of the common law. This is certainly a “transformation” of the common law, as Wade warned, and thus is firmly contra the approach carefully laid down in Douglas, Campbell and many others since 2000.Secondly, it is not simply that this middle ground persists as regards Section 6(3)(a). In fact, it is an approach discernible more broadly across the Human Rights Act. There are a number of principles of HRA adjudication disclosing a palpable recognition of the power that the Act gives courts, and a concomitant reticence to deploy that power unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps the most important example of this is the judgment of Lord Reed in ANS v ML22, which concerned Section 3 HRA. Recognising the enormous power of the Section to reinterpret Parliamentary legislation, Lord Reed felt the need to reiterate the manner in which it must be deployed, namely “only where the legislation, if read and given effect according to ordinary principles, would result in a breach of the Convention rights”.23 This is a clear example of a desire to ‘keep the powder dry’ more generally. Section 3, much like Section 6(3)(a), is an enormously powerful tool, and it is for precisely this reason that Lord Reed, exactly like the Court of Appeal in Fearn, felt the need to ensure the boundaries of its use were correctly and stringently regulated. In both cases, the courts therefore laid down a common approach, confirming that human rights arguments should not be deployed unless ordinary domestic law cannot cover the situation at hand. Thus, clearly, Mann J’s approach in Fearn does not simply go against the prevailing approach under Section 6(3)(a), it counteracts a more general desire discernible in HRA caselaw to ‘keep its powder dry’, and ensure its vast power is regulated.Thirdly, it is, of course, one thing to suggest that Mann J’s approach goes against the general trend of ‘keeping the powder dry’, but entirely another thing to suggest that he is wrong in doing so. Perhaps Wade was on to something – maybe human rights law should seek to implant itself into domestic common law as far as possible and have far greater horizontal effect than it does at present. However, it is submitted here that this is not as desirable as it might sound on the surface. The most common argument advanced in this direction is a purely constitutional one – the vast majority of the power afforded by the HRA goes to the judiciary, and the pseudo-legislative power in, among others, Sections 324 and 6(3)(a)25 has the potential, if misused, to upset the balance underpinning separation of powers. This argument is extremely powerful, but has been well-rehearsed, and there is no need to delve into it once again.Instead, it is submitted that there is an additional important reason for favouring the approach English law has of ‘keeping the powder dry’ – it ensures the immense normative power of human rights law is retained. Put simply, human rights law is at its most powerful when it is not overused. This is best demonstrated by Section 4 HRA, the power to issue declarations of incompatibility. The Section could not be clearer about the fact that it has no effect on any legislation to which it is applied as a matter of law.26 Despite this, however, by mid-2015, twenty Section 4 declarations had been finalised, and nineteen of those had resulted directly in a change in the law. The reason for this is simple – Section 4 declarations represent a legal pronouncement that a piece of legislation is in breach of human rights, and that is a statement that carries an enormous amount of political weight. This political weight comes from the fact that human rights law has enormous normative power, which, to no small degree, comes from the scarcity and rarity of its use.27 It is not hard to see that, if declarations of incompatibility were an everyday occurrence, they would quickly lose their effect, as the ‘shock factor’ inherent in a court pronouncing the existence of a human rights violation would quickly dissipate. The same can be said for human rights law as an overall discipline – in order for it to maintain its normative power, it must be seen as a corpus of law to which recourse is only necessary in extreme situations. Of course, no attempt is made here to suggest that Mann J’s approach would have resulted in the demise of human rights law as a discipline, and in the value of Section 4 declarations – such a conclusion would be extraordinarily melodramatic. However, it is maintained that the normative power of the HRA is a vital component of its success, and that the best way to maintain this power is to ensure it is not overused – to keep its powder dry. The Court of Appeal has recognised this in Fearn and is to be commended for so doing.ConclusionYeon’s suggestion that Mann J’s approach in the High Court in Fearn is “correct and appropriately restrained” is, it is submitted, simply not correct, either as a matter of precedent, or as a question of more general approach. As a matter of precedent, it runs contrary to established lines of authority from the highest level as regards horizontal effect under the HRA, and more generally, it goes against an established trend in HRA adjudication to ensure that, where possible, the HRA’s powder is kept dry. It is further submitted that this approach to the horizontal effect question is also defensible, for well-rehearsed but sound constitutional reasons, but also in order to ensure that the HRA’s normative power is maintained. Thus, for all these reasons, the approach of the Court of Appeal in Fearn is to be commended, as consistent, principled and, above all, restrained.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("A case note on Hudorovič and Others v SloveniaIntroductionHudorovič and Others v Slovenia1 is a case concerning Roma communities living in informal settlements who did not have adequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This case was fought in the context of Slovenia making the right to drinking water a constitutional right.2 This, however, did not become pertinent,3 and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found no violation of Article 84 by a 5:2 majority in the first application, and unanimously found no violations under the other Articles and for the second application. This case note critically analyses three themes in the judgment. First, it evaluates the Court’s assessment of the right to water, contrasting it with Indian constitutional jurisprudence, and the framework proposed by the dissenting judges. It further proposes a qualified right to water in European human rights law. Second, it argues that the majority decontextualized the position of the applicants in determining socio-economic issues. They ignored the history of social exclusion and inequality faced by the Roma people and the role of the state in addressing this, contrary to the concepts of substantive equality and positive obligations. This makes this case a ‘tale of two communities’. Finally, it notes the overarching theme of socio-economic rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), examining how the nature of the application in Hudorovič is difficult to fit within traditional European human rights law, and explains the tensions that emerge as a result. Before delving into the analysis, a brief summary of the facts is helpful. The first applicant and his son (the second applicant) in the first application lived in the informal Roma settlement of Goriča vas. Their hut had no access to water, sewage and sanitation because permits and documents could not be acquired to obtain access to public infrastructure, due to the irregular manner of establishing settlement. In the second application, a family of fourteen lived in an illegally built hut in an informal Roma settlement at Dobruška without access to water, sanitation or electricity. The applicants in both applications received monthly social assistance from the government. The applications were joined by the Court in light of the facts and substantive questions they raised. They argued violations of Articles 35, 8 and 146 of the Convention, alleging that their homes did not have access to basic public utilities and that they had been subjected to a negative and discriminatory attitude by local authorities. The opinion of the majority and the dissenting judges will be examined in the sections below. Human right to water?The first issue this piece discusses is whether there is a ‘right to water’ in European human rights law. It is submitted that the Court unduly limited the right, if recognising it at all. The majority opined that there must be a threshold of severity in assessing whether a lack of access to water and sanitation can constitute an interference with Article 8. Consequently, it held that ‘access to safe drinking water is not, as such, a right’,7 but that a ‘persistent and long-standing lack of access to safe drinking water can … have adverse consequences for health and human dignity effectively eroding the core of private life and the enjoyment of a home within the meaning of Article 8’.8This standard is notably problematic. First, it sets a high threshold with multiple components, such as the persistence and long-standing nature of the lack of access, which is complicated and may be challenging to prove. Second, the test is uncertain and ambiguous. It is unclear what the core of private life is in this case and what factors would erode it. A threat to survival would undeniably be included, but the boundary becomes blurry after that, especially when concepts such as human dignity and private life are involved, the meanings of which reasonable people may disagree on. This leads to uncertainty about whether an applicant is protected by the Convention at all and could also lead to demarcations which may cause some injustice based on who may fall outside the standard, and thus be without protection. Third, it is not clear what is gained by categorically rejecting a right to water. Following the Court’s jurisprudence on qualified rights, a right to water may have been recognised and limited in the public interest, such as the prevailing socio-economic circumstances, leading to no violation. On the other hand, to say that there is no prima facie right places the burden on the already disadvantaged applicant to prove why she should have the right, instead of requiring the state to outline why the right was not fulfilled. Thus, a consequentialist approach (focusing on the consequences of the act e.g. health concerns) further erodes human rights, which a deontological approach (based on the intrinsic value of the right to water) does not.Contrast the majority’s approach with Indian jurisprudence, which has taken a different approach to the same question. The Indian Supreme Court acknowledged that there is a right to water guaranteed by Article 21 (right to life) of the Indian Constitution.9 Since water is essential for human life to exist (in the Indian context), the much broader concept of private life (in European human rights jurisprudence), which essentially concerns itself with the quality of life,10 should include it as well. Additionally, it is worth noting that the usual constraints based on resource allocation are even more severe in a developing country such as India, so the weight attached to these arguments, at least for some countries in Europe, needs to be revaluated when balancing them against the right to a basic necessity. Even if these become critical factors for some states, they can be balanced at the proportionality stage, while still acknowledging that water is a right and not a privilege. The partially dissenting opinion (Judge Pavli joined by Judge Kūris) proposed a middle ground between the majority’s standard and the one proposed above, under which it would be sufficient to prove adverse consequences stemming from lack of access for an extended period. However, this leads to the issues highlighted above, related to proving consequences and their graveness, since the applicant would have to prove that there were harmful effects on their dignity, for instance, and that these were caused by a lack of access to water for an extended period. This second limb not only requires proving causation, but also the temporal aspect of the persistence of the deprivation. Due to these difficulties, the prima facie right model is a better framework, as it would require a presumption of the adverse consequences and the state would then have to justify these. The dissenting opinion did allude to this subsequently, noting that ‘[s]uch a right cannot, of course, be absolute’11, and consequently noted that this predicament ‘adversely affects core private life interests and basic human dignity,’12 by definition closer to the prima facie right model explained above. Thus, the model of starting with a qualified right to water and then addressing situations in which it may be limited is better suited to tackling these issues, which the majority’s opinion fails to acknowledge, but one reading of the minority opinion hints at. Social exclusion and inequalityThe second theme in the judgment is a lack of sensitivity to context i.e. the social position of the Roma community, generally and in this particular case. The Court had earlier acknowledged in Winterstein and Others v France13 that the Roma constitute a vulnerable minority, and that states ought to pay special consideration towards their needs. In spite of this, the majority in Hudorovič used the wide margin of appreciation in socio-economic matters to decontextualize their plight. Thus, once it was satisfied that Slovenia had made some efforts to realise its positive obligations, it did not ask whether this framework for providing access to utilities reached the marginalised. This is not to say that the Court should not defer to policy judgements of elected national representatives, but that it should assess the differential impact that a policy may have and whether the state is taking effective steps to mitigate that. This can be seen in three aspects of the judgment which at best ignore and at worst legitimise the discrimination faced by the applicants, albeit unintentionally. First, the judgment individualised a public good by noting that the state can reasonably leave installation of connections to the expense of individuals. This fails to acknowledge the disadvantaged position that many individuals (or communities) may be in, exacerbated by social exclusion. It is submitted that even if this can be the system for the majority, having positive obligations means that the state should at least assist those who do not have adequate means. Second, it was emphasised that the applicants were receiving social benefits, which could be used to improve their conditions. However, there was no assessment of whether these would cover this infrastructural investment, since social benefits aim to aid daily expenditure. Third, the Court noted other efforts, such as water tank deliveries, made by the state to ensure access ‘irrespective of how and whether it was realised’ in its assessment of Article 3.14 However, the minority pointed out the findings of independent expert missions which practically unanimously said that water tank deliveries were inadequate.15 It is unclear why making any effort was seen as an end in itself, when the goal was to ensure access for the community. Therefore, whether social security benefits and other policies were effective in ensuring the right to water or whether the applicants could in reality take matters into their own hands was never critically examined.Finally, also noteworthy in the judgment is the lack of attention paid to the bigger picture, i.e. unequal social relations. The Human Rights Centre of the University of Ghent16 noted that ‘forms of unequal treatment in Slovenia included preferential treatment of non-Roma in the development of infrastructure and the systemic failure to develop infrastructure in Roma communities.’17 Moreover, issues related to water and sanitation can not only be a form of discrimination, but also perpetuate discrimination. Unsanitary living conditions can lead to stigmatisation of a historically disadvantaged community and further alienate them from the majority. In light of this, it is questionable why the Court did not examine the Article 14 claim separately. What the applicants claimed was not merely a lack of access to water, but differential access, based on them belonging to the Roma community. The majority instead noted that access to sanitation facilities was limited in Slovenia, even in the majority areas, to absolve the state of its obligation to extend facilities to a marginalised community. This was exacerbated by an emphasis on the illegality of their housing, which meant that the state could forsake its positive obligations. This has rightly been criticised as an ‘overly formalistic approach’18 and the minority too criticised this eloquently:“[T]here is nothing objectionable about a State seeking to discourage illegal constructions and preserve public order by legally restricting their access to public utilities. However, in the specific context of Roma communities … the legality argument has been repeatedly rejected by this Court …“19The minority also explicitly acknowledged the acts of ‘less-than-friendly’ local authorities.20 This alludes to direct discrimination, a claim made by the applicants themselves, who argued that the state had failed to consider their needs as members of a disadvantaged group, indicated by discriminatory attitudes, prejudice and stereotypes of local authorities.21 Thus, it is important to focus on the historical context to closely scrutinise the applicants’ claims, but in the majority opinion it seemed as though the role of the state in discrimination against Roma communities was not only ignored, but also inadvertently legitimised by focusing on formalism and uncritically accepting any policy effort. Socio-economic rights and the ConventionThe ECHR, a product of the post-war period, ‘focuses almost entirely on the traditional canon of civil and political rights,’22 even purposefully omitting socio-economic rights.23 However, the Court’s case law has laid down the foundation for socio-economic rights as complementing the Convention.24 Contrary to being unfaithful to the text, this is a means of ensuring that the Convention remains dynamic and evolves with changing times, such as the inclusion of rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which found no mention in the original text.Yet this chasm between text and jurisprudence leads to certain tensions. For instance, the Article 14 jurisprudence has been criticised for being formalistic.25 This can be seen in the present case too. A wide margin of appreciation led to minimal examination of the claims the state was making about its infrastructure, which means deference to executive authorities. Subsequently, an ahistorical assessment meant that factors such as the illegality of the housing were taken into account, an instance of the underlying formalism in Hudorovič (see above). In spite of this critique, an examination of Article 14 was crucial in this case for reasons explained previously (i.e. the unequal distribution of public utilities). Others have argued that there is also an inherent bias in the Court’s Article 8 jurisprudence, towards negative interference instead of positive obligations associated with socio-economic rights.26 While the Court has produced some path-breaking judgments on positive obligations in the past, this critique finds some support in Hudorovič. The traditional role of Article 8 was to prevent adverse state action and not to mandate it to do something, the classic distinction drawn between negative and positive rights. Thus, there is some hesitation in examining the state’s current efforts and legally mandating it to do more in the judgment, which would require significant infrastructural investment. Another tension can also be seen in balancing the role of judges and the government,27 which invites the criticism of deference made above, but also raises questions about the limits of the law and judicial expertise. For instance, to what extent can a court assess the budgetary allocations the state must make in order to fulfil its legal obligation of providing public utilities? Hence, there is some reluctance to find socio-economic rights as coming within the protection of private and family life.28Ultimately, Hudorovič was about social inequality. In side-stepping that, the judgment shows the uneasy position of socio-economic rights in European human rights law. The dissenting opinion captures the crux of the issue perfectly:If one looks beyond formalities, the case of the first applicants from Goriča vas is ultimately a tale of two communities, one Roma and one belonging to the majority, living a stone’s throw from each other – one of them has running water coming out of their taps, and the other has never had it at all for over thirty years. This in a country with an annual GDP per capita upwards of 20,000 euros.29One may argue that remaining faithful to the original text is more important than its judge-led evolution, and the tensions noted above only reinforce that. However, the context in which cases are argued in front of the Strasbourg Court has changed considerably since the Second World War, and as state action into the lives of individuals and communities increases, so does its obligations and responsibilities,30 especially towards those who have historically been at the margins of European society. To turn a blind eye to what some may call ‘state-sanctioned’ poverty’,31 is as much a human rights violation as any other. This judgment, unfortunately, does nothing to recognise that, and the consequence of that is upholding an unequal status quo:“The finding of no violation by the majority … will contribute little, I fear, to alleviating the plight of inequality and disadvantage that many European Roma continue to face.”32Concluding remarksThis case note has examined the tensions in the case of Hudorovič and Others v Slovenia under the umbrella of the relationship between socio-economic rights and the ECHR. It has critiqued the judgment for its failure to protect, or sufficiently protect, the right to water. It has also contextualised this right in a historically unequal society, noting that the Court did not pay adequate attention to this factual background. Finally, it located this case and others like it within a larger debate about whether and how non-traditional rights are to be enforced in European human rights law, concluding that while the jurisprudence may have its shortcomings, the cost of not recognising these rights is far too high. Since human rights law is constantly evolving and recognising new rights and rights-bearers, one can hope that the status quo would change some day. I would like to thank Dr Sarah Trotter for her valuable comments and suggestions.Mythili Mishra".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("A critical review of the ECJ’s Judgments on ‘Gmail’ and ‘Skype Out’Abstract:The Over-the-Top (OTT) services have successfully competed with “traditional” telecommunications services and disrupted the market for short messages, phone and video calls. While WhatsApp alone processed an average of over 65 billion messages per day in May 2018, this is true for “only” 22.7 billion messages sent via SMS. The stunning success of OTT services like Gmail, Viber, Skype etc. is also due to the different regulation frameworks that apply to telecommunications services and OTT services. With its judgments on Gmail and Skype Out in June 2019 the ECJ finally clarified the legal situation,  subjecting Skype Out under telecommunications law, but not Gmail. This essay shall give a short overview on the key findings of the ECJ’s judgments, critically evaluating the argumentation of the court.I. IntroductionThe rise of the Web 2.0, the widespread distribution of smart phones, and the development of new digital platforms have shaken many economic branches and turned a great number of business models upside down. This is especially true for the telecommunication sector where so-called “Over the Top” (OTT) services have successfully competed with “traditional” telecommunications services and disrupted the market for short messages, phone and video calls. 1 The stunning success of OTT-services like Gmail, WhatsApp, Skype etc. is due to many factors. Yet, it cannot be overlooked that the market is no “level playing field”, especially regarding  European regulation.               When regulating these services, internet access providers (IAP) are treated differently than internet service providers (ISP). The regulatory framework of the transmission of signals is different to that of the transmission of content. This relates to the distinct roles assumed by ISPs and IAPs in the digital market. The service of an ISP is brought to the user over the open internet. ISPs usually don’t operate their own network infrastructures, but run software and, if necessary, some central servers. They provide almost all imaginable services rendered via the internet and range from chat applications and social networks (WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook) to streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube) and e-commerce platforms (ebay, Amazon, alibaba). The service of the IAPs, on the other hand, is limited to connecting the user (and often the ISPs too) to the internet. They only provide internet access and have no influence on the nature or content of the ISPs’ services. However,  IAPs are essential for ISPs as their services couldn’t be brought to the users without internet connectivity. An IAP provides individuals access to the internet, employing a range of technologies to connect users via their own network with the open internet. Larger IAP companies in the UK are, for example, Vodafone, British Telecom or Three.ISPs or “information society services”2 are subject to an array of different European directives depending on the kind of services they are offering, whereas IAPs are mainly regulated by the “Framework Directive for Electronic Communications Networks and Services” (Directive 2002/21/EC) and its related directives. These two frameworks differ significantly in their respective approaches and their levels of regulation. While the telecommunication sector has traditionally been heavily regulated, OTT services are almost not regulated at all.3 It is, therefore, hardly surprising that one of the top priorities of the “Digital Single Markets Strategy” of the European Commission is to create “[…] the right conditions for digital networks and services to flourish”. According to the European Commission, this requires “[…] the right regulatory conditions for innovation, investment, fair competition and a level playing field.”4In addition, regulatory authorities have repeatedly attempted to subject OTT service providers to the same regulation as “traditional” telecommunications providers by classifying them as providers of “electronic communications services” in the meaning of Art. 2 lit. c Directive 2002/21/EC.5 As this would mean a much stricter regulation on OTT services and a significant increase in power for regulatory authorities, this matter was highly controversial until the ECJ issued  two fundamental judgements on the email service Gmail of Google6 and the VoIP service Skype Out of Skype Communications.7 This essay shall give a short overview on the key findings of the ECJ and critically evaluate the argumentation of the court.II. Essential technical features of “Gmail” and “Skype Out”In the aforementioned cases, the ECJ adopts a functional-technical interpretation of the law. A technical understanding of the characteristics of the respective OTT service is essential. The BEREC8 describes OTT services as “a content, a service or an application that is provided to the end user over the public internet”.9 However, as this definition refers more to the method of the provision, rather than a particular type of service, it does not yet provide any understanding of the concept. Almost any available service on the internet could then be qualified as an OTT service.10 As this essay focuses on competitive effects of OTT services on the telecommunications industry, only those OTT services which enable individual communication over the internet and offer an alternative to “traditional” telecommunications services shall be deemed to be OTT services.The services Gmail and Skype Out differ mostly in their technical structure. Gmail provides its users with a service that enables them to send and receive emails and data over the internet. The service is based on a ‘client server architecture’. This  means that all relevant user data is processed, stored, and forwarded to other internet users over central servers. It associates the email addresses with the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the corresponding terminal device, splits the messages into data packets, and uploads them or receives them from the internet for the purposes of transmitting them to their recipients. The conveyance of signals occurs essentially over the open internet.11 Internet access providers transmit those signals on behalf of the user as a service rendered under a service contract with the user.Skype Communications offers the Skype Out service as an additional feature of the communication software Skype.  This allows users to make calls from a terminal, where the software is installed, to a fixed or mobile telephone line using the Internet Protocol. The signal is first conveyed by an internet access provider, over the open internet, to a gateway where the further transmission is carried out by a telecommunications service provider via the PSTN.12 For this purpose, Skype Communications has concluded an agreement with the telecommunications service provider which is also remunerated for its services.13III. The legal classification by the ECJThe key issue in both judgements of the ECJ is whether the service delivered by the OTT service providers “[…] consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals on electronic communications networks”.14The court begins in the Gmail case by emphasizing the regulatory distinction between the production of content and the transmission of content, since “[…] content and transmission [are] being covered by different measures which pursue their own specific objectives”.15 However, what at first sight seems to be a simple and clear distinction is blurred by the court itself as it admits in the Skype Out and Gmail cases that the OTT services convey signals on electronic communications networks. Therefore, the court goes on, the service must consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals in order to be classified as an electronic communications service and this is only the case with Skype Out. In the case of Gmail, it is mainly the IAPs of the senders and recipients which convey the signals necessary for the functioning of the service. By applying a quantitative criterion in its assessment, the court follows the technology-neutral approach of the Framework Directive.16 Yet, the distinction between the production and the transmission of content is less plausible due to the arbitrary evaluation of open terms (“wholly or mainly”) by the court. In order to substantiate its reasoning with a more objective criterion the court introduces therefore the concept of responsibility. The decisive factor is according to the court whether the provider is ultimately responsible to the user for the proper functioning of the service. The court states in both cases that “[…] all that matters […] is that that the provider is responsible vis-à-vis the end-users for transmission of the signal”.17 Whilst the participation of Gmail in the sending and receiving of messages “[…] does not appear to be sufficient to [regard the service of Gmail] as consisting ‘wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals’, the court holds that Skype Communications has assumed responsibility vis-à-vis the end-users for the transmission of voice signals on the PSTN18 only by the (contractual) involvement of telecommunications service providers authorised to send and terminate calls to fixed or mobile telephone numbers via the PSTN. As a consequence, the ECJ considers only Skype Out to be an ‘electronic communications service’, while Gmail remains unregulated by the Framework Directive.IV. Critical evaluationThe findings of the court are noteworthy considering the fact that Google itself owns an internet connected network infrastructure, which is also used for the purposes of the conveyance of signals for Gmail. However, this is “of no relevance to the classification of the nature of the service” for the court.19 Yet, following the logic of the ECJ leads to very strange results. Would the court have ruled differently if Skype Communications had its own PSTN infrastructure? What if Google only rented its infrastructure? The court does not deliver any explanation on why an internet connected network infrastructure and a PSTN should be treated differently in the regulatory classification of OTT services. The strong focus on the technical architecture gives the outcome of the legal assessment a arbitrary appearance. The different classification of the two OTT service providers is even more puzzling when the fact that Skype Communications excluded, in its general terms and conditions, any liability for the transmission of signals to the end-users is taken into account. Viewed from the end-users’ perspective, only the ISP and the telecommunications service provider remain responsible for transmitting the signals.The further arguments of the court are unconvincing too. The court states, “[t]he fact that Google must be regarded as supplying electronic communications services as the operator of its own electronic communications networks […] does not mean that all the web-based services which it supplies must also be treated as electronic communications services, even though they do not consist wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals.”20 This argument is void, only reaffirming  in numerous words the statement of the court that it does not consider the electronic communications networks of Google in the classification of Gmail. Legal or technical arguments in this regard are nowhere to be found.Furthermore, the judgements lack  a definition to the term of “service” within the meaning of Art. 2 lit. c) Framework Directive. Many services consist of several different sub-services such as Voice over IP, messaging or communication with chatbots. If the key criterion is whether “the service” consists wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals, a sharp definition of what features amount to a “service” is essential. Nonetheless, the court leaves many questions unanswered in this regard. The court fails to establish clear criteria as to when a particular feature of a provider is to be regarded as a service in the meaning of the Framework Directive. Especially in the case of Skype Out, a clear outline of the term would have been desirable, as the installation of the Skype Out feature on a terminal requires the prior installation of the Skype software, which already offers an array of (sub-)services that cannot be classified as ‘electronic communications services’.21 In the end, the judgement of the ECJ represents a missed opportunity to put things right. A teleological approach, which also takes into account the competitive substitution effect of OTT services, would have been more appropriate. Above all, the different classification is flawed as both services provide their users with classical individual communication tools. Content-related components are fading into the background or do not even exist. Both services should be treated equally.The Administrative Court of Cologne, in the lower instance, had focused on whether Gmail had “factually adopted” the signal transmission of the IAP and stated that it is the user that “gives the decisive impulse for signal transmission”.22 The court therefore concluded that Gmail makes an essential contribution to the functioning of the telecommunication process and qualifies as an ‘electronic communications service’.23 This approach leaves the technical particularities out of the picture and focuses on the functionalities of the Gmail service. As this legal view would subject both services - Gmail and Skype Out – equally to telecommunications regulation, it is only to be welcomed. However, the application of regulatory means and measures requires the utmost tact and sensitivity in order to maintain the inventive strength of OTT services. The challenge for authorities will be to establish a regulatory balance between data protection, consumer protection and a functioning market without stifling innovation and industry growth.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("Introduction:In its recent report, the ILC addressed two main outstanding issues relating to jus cogens norms: the existence of regional jus cogens and the possibility of an illustrative list.1 The report concludes with draft conclusion 24, which proposes a non-exhaustive list of the “most widely recognised”2 peremptory norms, such as the prohibition of genocide and aggressive use of force. Peremptory norms are no doubt a “positive part of international law,”3 yet are still conceptualised by some as “a dramatic (or threatening) magic.”4 The ILC’s report is perhaps an attempt to concretise jus cogens as, in Kolb’s words, an “operational concept of law”, rather than a mere extension of natural law theory or lofty ideals. This post offers the thesis that, whilst such a mission is admirable, the operation of peremptory norms as envisaged by the ‘hierarchy theory’5 remains impeded by the dominance of treaties as a source of international law. Furthermore, this seems unlikely to change in the immediate future because treaties are a primary vehicle for the enforcement of state sovereignty, which remains paramount in an international legal sphere dominated by positivist notions of state consent. The conflict is thus characterised by the dichotomy between realpolitik and international ideals.‘Treaty’ will be used in the sense envisaged by Article 2(1)(a) VCLT – “[a]n international agreement concluded between states… and governed by international law…”. This post proceeds from the definition of ‘peremptory norm’ offered by H.R. Fabri, who characterises it as a “hierarchy (of norms) … linked in turn with the idea of safeguarding… a supposedly universal, common core of human values.”6 Another critical feature of jus cogens norms is pointed out by Kolb, who states that such a norm “does not allow derogation”7; likewise, Ragazzi highlights the “disability” of States to “contract out of” a norm of jus cogens.8 The non-conditionality of peremptory norms would seem to make their applicability a simple matter, but this is not borne out in reality for several reasons. Firstly, the article considers the treatment of peremptory norms and treaties by international courts; secondly, it considers the socio-legal importance of treaties and *jus cogens norms.The issue of the hierarchy theory, and the operation of peremptory norms versus treaties, remains important despite the large volumes of literature on the subject. If peremptory norms are to assume the role assigned to them – to protect normative ideals and prevent gross infringements of human rights – they must have practical bite. The obstacles to progression must therefore be recognised in order to be overcome. There is otherwise the danger that peremptory norms become merely a theoretical ideal.1) Courts and the Hierarchy Theory The consequences of jus cogens norms are made explicitly clear by Art. 53 VCLT 1969: “A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law.” Furthermore, Art. 64 gives retrospective application to jus cogens: “If a new peremptory norm of general international law emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates.” This embodies the ‘hierarchy’ or ‘trumping’ argument, as expressed by Bates: jus cogens norms are to prevail over all other sources of international law, including treaties.9 However, although jus cogens are certainly acknowledged by international courts, it is argued that they are a less favoured means of deciding cases than treaties. Crawford admits that they remain “something of a curiosity”10. Hence, “few are the instances in which a court or tribunal has applied the concept so as to determine the outcome of a case.”11 This is a critical observation illustrated by the case of Al-Adsani.12In Al-Adsani, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) rejected the argument that application of the doctrine of state immunity to Kuwait, under the SIA 1978, infringed his rights under Art. 3 ECHR (prohibition on torture) and Art. 6 (right to a fair trial). The applicant argued that his claim related to torture, the prohibition of which is a jus cogens norm, and hence such prohibition took “precedence over treaty law and other rules of international law”13. A majority of 9:8 held that the Art.3 right had not been infringed: “notwithstanding” the “special character” of the prohibition of torture, the Court found itself unable to discern in the “the international instruments, judicial authorities or other materials” any basis for the applicant’s argument.14  The case is significant because, as a treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be hierarchically subordinate to the prohibition of torture as a jus cogens norm. Thus, according to the hierarchy theory, the ECHR was the wrong yardstick by which to measure the applicant’s case.Of particular note is the centrality of multilateral treaties in the Court’s reasoning – the court noted that “none of the primary international instruments referred to (Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 2 and 4 of the UN Convention) relates to civil proceedings or to State immunity.”15 This is illuminating as it suggests that the ‘hierarchy’ envisaged by the VCLT 1969 is not being enforced at the judicial level. If the hierarchy model is correct, the jus cogens prohibition of torture should have taken clear precedence, such that recourse to the aforementioned treaties would be irrelevant. If peremptory norms are at the apex of the hierarchy, why mention treaties at all?Furthermore, the Court referred to the ILC’s 1999 Report on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property.16 Citing the working group’s findings, it noted that whilst some states had shown “some sympathy” for the idea that state immunity should be waived where it conflicted with peremptory norms, “in most cases… the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded.”17 The Concurring Opinion of Judge Pellonpää joined by Sir Nicolas Bratza is also illuminating:“Although giving absolute priority to the prohibition of torture may at first sight seem very “progressive”, a more careful consideration tends to confirm that such a step would also run the risk of proving a sort of “Pyrrhic victory”. International cooperation, including cooperation with a view to eradicating the vice of torture, presupposes the continuing existence of certain elements of a basic framework for the conduct of international relations.”18This suggests a certain judicial reticence in developing international law beyond what is accepted by states. The Court’s reasoning appears to be driven by two main considerations: i) the lack of state practice in waiving state immunity in favour of jus cogens norms; ii) the centrality of state immunity in diplomatic relations between states, and the policy implications of impeding such immunity. This is clearly at odds with the functionality envisaged by the ILC report, which requires jus cogens to ‘trump’ treaties in order to fulfil their role of safeguarding human rights considerations.It may be argued that the hierarchical concept of jus cogens was nevertheless acknowledged in the Al-Adsani judgment: the Joint Dissenting Opinion considered that “the basic characteristic of a jus cogens rule is that, as a source of law in the now vertical international legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same status.”19 Thus, the hierarchy theory is acknowledged by at least some amongst the judiciary. However, this does not convince as a counterargument. As Bates points out, jus cogens “only really featured in the reasoning of the minority, with the majority taking their stand on different reasoning.”20 This post has already illustrated how the reasoning of the majority centred around multilateral treaties and policy considerations. Moreover, Bates persuasively suggests that this is not merely an outlier amidst a sea of acceptance of the hierarchy theory: he cites the  Arrest Warrant Case21 as illustration of the fact that “a jus cogens norm did not automatically make ineffective other rules of international law.”22 Both the Arrest Warrant Case and the case of Jones23 are examples of rulings in which claims to state immunity were upheld despite suspected violations of jus cogens norms. In Jones, the House of Lords upheld Saudi Arabia’s claim to state immunity despite the applicants’ allegations of torture at the hands of Saudi officials. This “hammered another nail in the coffin”24 of the hierarchy theory, and indeed it submitted that the theory is currently treading water. Whether it will remain so in the future is beyond the scope of this post.A final possible counter-argument against this state of affairs may be found in the argument of Cassese, who suggests that no “consistent practice”25 of jus cogens norm by states is necessary to render them operational; it is sufficient for members of the international community to “evince” acceptance of the norm. The rejection of ‘consistent practice’ as the benchmark of recognition would seem to imply that any statement by a state indicating acceptance of a norm as jus cogens would do. The implications of this argument are thus that enforcement of the hierarchy theory by courts is neither here nor there: jus cogens are operational, whether or not this is reflected in practice. This is superficially attractive as an argument: it seems to adhere to the intuition that the highest human rights ideals, such as prohibition of genocide and torture, should not depend for their existence on the whims of States or courts. For example, it is not seriously contested that prohibition of torture is a jus cogens norm, even though States have and do torture individuals.However, Cassese ultimately provides the correct answer to the wrong question. “Most” international lawyers accept the existence of jus cogens and also accept their “operation” within a system of international law, as pointed out by O’Connell.26 What this post questions about, however, is the practical operation of jus cogens vis-à-vis treaties. In this sense, Cassese is over-idealistic. The idea that peremptory norms trump all other sources of international law is a hollow statement if courts reject the hierarchy in the first place. According greater importance to treaties becomes an easier way of ensuring that the development of international law does not too often outpace what is accepted by states (since treaties, by definition, are built around the intentions of the parties). Lord Lloyd-Jones concurs with the approach in Al-Adsani: there is a need for “judicial restraint in developing international law beyond what is accepted by States.”27 Cassese himself acknowledges the lack of ‘bite’ of jus cogens: it has “never had the effect proper to the notion,”28 i.e., to nullify a treaty contrary to its content. Cassese conversely posits that jus cogens have “perhaps”29 fulfilled a deterring role by forestalling the conclusion of agreements contrary to peremptory norms, and thus cannot be characterised as a “flop”. However, this is firstly very difficult to prove beyond doubt, and secondly, as seen by the examples given in section 2), States can and do enter into and revoke treaty obligations even if this will have a deprecative effect on jus cogens norms (for example, the withdrawal from a treaty designed to impede aggression and/or use of nuclear weapons).30 It is ultimately difficult to reconcile Cassese’ faith in the theoretical success of jus cogens with the practice of states and courts.The explanation for jus cogen’s lack of bite is helpfully spelled out by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, as referenced by O’Connell.31 This stated that:“… the only method of deriving [jus cogens] [is] judicial determination. Thus, it [is] left to the judge to extract jus cogens limitations from the legal system as a whole…“32Hence, the ‘hierarchy theory’, despite its embodiment in Arts. 53 and 64 VCLT, appears to have been declawed by the Courts. Peremptory norms may not depend on state practice for their existence but, in realistic terms, they depend on judicial enforcement for their operation as the ‘trump cards’ of international law. It is submitted that this will significantly impede the fulfilment, in practice, of Kolb’s conception of jus cogens as an “operational concept of law”. Deprived of a bite, jus cogens cede their position in the normative hierarchy of international law to treaties.2) Jus Cogens as new international law?On a final note, this article turns to the argument that jus cogens will supersede treaties as a source of international law because they are representative of a ‘new’ international order, in which human rights concerns prevail. Cassese aptly summarises this position: jus cogens are a “hallmark” of the “new international community” – for the first time, peremptory norms restrain the “hitherto unlimited lawmaking power of states.”33 They thus represent a “novel approach” to international relations in which “community concerns”, to some extent, prevail over States’ self-interest. The inference is that peremptory norms are the better means of delivering outcomes which adhere to international human rights standards, whilst treaties are somewhat outmoded because they promote state or party sovereignty.There is the potential for discussion on this point which far exceeds the scope of this post. Nonetheless, it is sufficient for our purposes to briefly point out that this argument falls into the familiar trap of over-simplification. It is true that jus cogens represents an inroad into ‘traditional’ sources of international law, insofar as they are normative safeguards of the most basic human rights. However, it is a mistake to suppose that i) treaties are no longer ‘contemporary’, or that ii) there is no overlap in normative function between treaties and jus cogens – treaties can also play a role in safeguarding human rights. International law is “shaped and constrained” by the “norms” of international society,34 but this is not the exclusive purview of jus cogens alone.Recent developments are an apt reminder of the prevalence of treaties as a source of international obligations. In 2017, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.35 Stalled negotiations between the EU and Switzerland over a treaty have disrupted “cross-border share trading and strained bilateral ties.”36  As of August 2nd, 2019, the US formally withdrew from the 1987 INF Treaty.37 Treaties, rather than jus cogens, still form the blueprint for many international agreements and developments. Treaties concretise the intentions of states and, thus, reaffirm state sovereignty. This is not a function which can be overtaken by peremptory norms as these are not concerned with States’ self-interest. This is nonetheless not to say that the two share some roles; notably, their  mutual capacity to safeguard normative ideals.In her May 2019 lecture at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, Leila Sadat38 dealt extensively with the role of the Rome Statute in establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the challenges posed to the Treaty by protectionist State policies. This serves as a pertinent example of a treaty which, in establishing the ICC, performed a human rights function in ensuring a mechanism by which perpetrators of the worst abuses could be brought to justice.Admittedly, however, the need to remain vigilant as to the implications of realpolitik and state practice remains: for example, US National Security Advisor John Bolton has previously attacked the ICC,39 potentially undermining the work of the court in enforcing jus cogens norms in relation to crimes against humanity. The US is also not a State Party to the Rome Statute, despite its ratification by many other States. Politics has the potential to outflank legality insofar as state sovereignty remains decisive. Thus, the problem of less-than-ideal political realities in enforcing jus cogens is not fully satisfied either by a reliance solely on treaties or solely on courts. Nonetheless, the power of treaties as a source of international law remains strong because they are a convenient means of safeguarding the interests of individual states. Peremptory norms often do not have this advantage, unless they happen to be embedded in treaties which provide some service to the interests of states: for example, Art. 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the “threat or use of force” against the “territorial integrity or political independence” of any State. This embodies the peremptory norm against aggression or use of force. However, it is also beneficial to states insofar as it provides some protection for their territorial and political sovereignty.In sum, it is perhaps a disservice to peremptory norms to compartmentalise them wholly from treaties. If jus cogens are to be effective, they must represent concrete action as well as lofty ideals. This is best understood when it is recognised that jus cogens are merely one route to a common destination. Future enforcement of jus cogens may, in theory, be made more effective by a flexible approach which considers treaties and jus cogens (especially where a treaty purports to represent jus cogens) in tandem. Unfortunately, the discussion of the Al-Adsani case in section 1) above demonstrates the judicial tendency to consider jus cogens in isolation from treaties and to give preference to the treaties.ConclusionKolb rightly concludes that “there can be no doubt as to the necessity of the notion of jus cogens in a fully-fledged legal order whose development has moved beyond the most primitive stages…“40 Peremptory norms play a vital function in policing the normativity of international law. However, at least two significant problems have emerged from this discussion: i) peremptory norms are dependent on judicial enforcement and thus their efficacy is compromised, as the case of Al-Adsani demonstrates; ii) reliance on treaties remains a tempting alternative in cases where policy or state practice would render the enforcement of a jus cogens norm inconvenient. The cumulative effect of these issues is to remove the practical bite from Arts. 53 and 64 VCLT. Without implementation by international courts, the hierarchy argument is little more than a theoretical ideal. Hence, whilst the ILC Report is right to highlight other issues, such as the controversy over regional jus cogens, the comprehensive image of peremptory norms envisioned by the report’s draft conclusion 24 is as yet an ideal. The chasm between the archetype and the reality is something which must be resolved if peremptory norms are to keep up with treaties as a means of resolving cases in international law. Hopefully there may yet be a reconciliation of Cassese’ faith in jus cogens and political realism.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("AbstractUS protectionist measures in modern history reached a new apex in 2018 when tariffs against steel and aluminium imports were announced, which particularly affected China, the state posing a sharp political and economic contrast to US. Not only did this trigger retaliatory measures but it also made the US a target of further World Trade Organisation (WTO) complaints from 9 Member States in relation to violations of the GATT articles, which promote trade liberalism. The US sought to defend itself using Article XXI’s national security exception. This article, however, purports to show that the US would not be successful in availing itself of Article XXI. The developments in the WTO Panel’s position regarding the reviewability of a nation’s measures invite greater scrutiny, posing a challenge to  US’s claim. The tariffs on steel and aluminium may be associated with a stronger national defence, hence showing an ‘essential security interest’. Furthermore, it is improbable that demonstrating a belief in the nexus between the tariffs and national defence will be a hurdle due to the low threshold of good faith. Instead, the demise of the US justification using Article XXI may be brought due to the inability of establishing that the circumstances were an ‘emergency in international relations’ and necessitated the tariffs.I) IntroductionIn the context of a rapidly globalising world, the increase in protectionist measures, including trade barriers, by nations acting independently is a step backwards and indeed “the last thing the global economy needs”.1 The current era is marked distinctly by economic competition between the two largest economies of the world, the US and China. The anti-multilateral trade policy actions became evident right after President Trump took office and announced the withdrawal of the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).2 However, the most blatantly protectionist measure, the subject of this article, were the tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. In 2018, Trump announced that a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminium would be implemented on imports from various nations including China. This was enacted using an obscure provision in US domestic law, and the breach of the international prohibition on trade restricting measures was justified on grounds of national security.3 The American claim was that the strategic importance of steel and aluminium rendered the enforcing of tariffs crucial so that the domestic production losses were minimised and capability for supporting national industry of the metals was adequately developed for national defence and military purposes.4US tariffs against China caused turbulence in international trade law due to breaching the Most Favoured Nation principle of GATT Article I, according to which countries are not permitted to discriminate between their trading partners.5 As the US and China are party to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a lower or higher tariff must be applied to imports originating from all Member States without differentiation. Therefore, in order to enact a tariff, the Trump administration invoked the strict, seldom-used national security exception of Article XXI and asserted that the context was a time of ‘emergency in international relations’.6 This gave rise to the question of whether the national security exception could be utilised by the US, where the crisis does not occur in the context of a conventional military conflict.7 This article seeks to demonstrate the difficulty of applying the national security exception to defend US tariffs on China within the WTO ambit of rules. The article begins by exploring the text of Article XXI and observing the impact of the Russia-Ukraine dispute on the reviewability of the US-China assertions in subjecting the dispute to greater scrutiny. It contends that although the national security exception is narrow and largely within Member State discretion, it allows for non-military, economic situations to fulfil the ‘essential security interest’ requirement. Establishing a connection between the rationale behind the measure and the essential security interest is a grey area of ascertaining the true state intention, but this problem is swiftly overcome by the low threshold of only requiring good faith action by the Member. The specific case of the US steel and aluminium tariffs may, however, fall short of demonstrating the seriousness of tensions and thus, a real ‘emergency’. Hence, it would not be covered by Article XXI, leading either to a lose-lose decision by the WTO Panel, which weakens the WTO regime, or an unrewarding settlement.II) Text of Article XXI and ReviewabilityArticle XXI of GATT reads as follows:Nothing in this Agreement shall be construeda) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; orb) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interestsi. relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;ii. relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment;iii. taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; orc) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.8Article XXI was drafted with an intention to balance various interests. It aimed to “take care of real security interests and, at the same time … limit the exception so as to prevent the adoption of protection for maintaining industries under every conceivable circumstance”.9 It is a product of the desire to give countries enough leeway to institute measures required for security reasons and simultaneously prevent them from abusing Article XXI for advancing commercial ambitions. As such, the US tariffs bring discomfort among officials, because it appears to mix the “politics of international disputes into the legal world of trade and business” under the camouflage of national security.10Until April 2019, many contested and unclarified sections of Article XXI, such as reviewability, remained opaque due to its limited jurisprudence. Till then, only one Panel report had been adopted out of the seven GATT disputes regarding the security exception and the three WTO disputes which were all settled.11 On 5 April 2019, the WTO issued its first ruling, a binding decision, on the national security exception and clarified the institution’s stance on the reviewability of the exception. The dispute arose between Russia and Ukraine due to measures taken by Russia which compelled transport going from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to follow specific routes. These were subject to additional conditions and obtaining derogations from authorities, thus constituting complete bans.12 Ukraine complained about the breaches of GATT obligation and Russia replied by stating that the action was necessary for protecting its essential security interests. Russia’s assertion was that the Crimean events of 2014 amounted to an ‘emergency in international relations’ and threatened Russian border security. Furthermore, Russia contended that Article XXI(b)(iii) fell entirely within a Member’s remit to judge and that the WTO Panel may only acknowledge the invoking of the national security exception without examining the merits of the claim.13 This perception of Article XXI(b)(iii) as ‘non-justiciable’ has historically been shared by the US, which has publicly stated its opposition to reviewability, and it was argued that a Member should not be prohibited from acting in a manner that it perceives as necessary for the protection of its essential interests. The WTO Panel disagreed with the Russian perspective on reviewability. It clarified that the WTO Panel may review actions under the security exception of Article XXI(b) and that it was objectively discernible whether one of the three subparagraphs of (b) had occurred. Moreover, the ruling stated that the Panel could also review the measure itself to assess if it was truly believed that the measure was necessary for the safeguarding of the essential security interest and if the measure and the security interest are plausibly related.14  The only assessment that rested entirely in Members’ hands and would not be objectively reviewed by the WTO was the determination of the ‘necessity’ of the measure employed for achieving national security interests. The reason the WTO decided largely in favour of reviewability was in light of the logical structure of Article XXI(b). It was interpreted that the structure of this subsection was intended to limit Member State discretion in invoking the exceptions. If the assessment as to whether the requirements of the subsection were fulfilled were left to Members, the clauses would be stripped of any practical effect.15 In addition, it would result in Members being able to unilaterally discontinue their obligations under the GATT treaty, which would leave the impacted states unprotected and contradict the aim of WTO law to “promote the security and predictability” in trade agreements.16 These ground-breaking findings, however, may be amended or overturned if either Russia or Ukraine appealed to the Appellate Body.17The rejection of the Russian and the US position on (un)reviewability could endanger the viability of the US claim of national security in justifying tariffs, because the ruling invites greater WTO scrutiny on the measures: their necessity and the plausibility of its link with national security interests.18 The ruling reduces the possibility of exploiting the national security exception where the links between an essential security interest and the trade restriction are tenuous, or where the context or rationale is a non-emergency.19 An entirely deferential approach to the national security exception would have also contradicted the historic search for an equilibrium between protecting security interests and preventing Members from maintaining their own industries in all circumstances. This ruling prevents Members from easily deviating from the GATT commitments and it ensures that the provision does not automatically permit everything under the sun whenever it is branded as being necessary to protect an essential national interest.20As the national security exception would be closely reviewed, Article XXI(b)(iii) is no longer a wildcard that could be used by nations to circumvent trade law obligations. The next part of the paper seeks to analyse if US tariffs would survive WTO’s extensive review and whether their measure could tenably be justified on the ground of national security.II) Applying the National Security ExceptionA) 'Essential Security Interest'The first aspect of the legal test under article XXI is whether there was an essential security interest at stake.21In the determination of whether there was an essential interest at stake, Members are afforded a large margin of appreciation. An essential security interest is an inherently stricter requirement than ‘security interests’ alone and is said to refer to “quintessential functions of the state, namely, the protection of its territory and its population from external threats, and the maintenance of law and public order internally”.22 In past national security disputes, it has been contended on numerous occasions that “every country must be the judge in the last resort on questions relating to its own security”23 and that “each contracting party was the sole judge of what was necessary in its essential security interest”.24 This is hardly surprising given that the text of Article XXI states that it does not prevent Members from taking action ‘which it considers’ necessary, thus highlighting the subjective nature of this assessment. The stated interest could range from government employee benefits, effective transportation of imports and exports or development of nuclear forces.25 Therefore, a country has wide discretion to identify its essential security interests.In the context of the the US-China trade war, the US articulated that the essential security interest threatened by steel and aluminium imports from China was national defence.  It was officially stated that the quantity of steel and aluminium imports threatened domestic production sites with closures and was reducing national capacity to independently produce steel and aluminium items if a national defence emergency took place.26 Additionally, the tariffs were imposed to encourage the preservation of the vital skills in the US economy and labour force. Given the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in assessing whether their national security interest is threatened, it is unquestionable that the US has the discretion to state that national defence is an essential security interest. However, the more difficult question is how the state discretion is tempered, and in particular, whether the concept of an ‘essential security interest’ can sufficiently accommodate non-military and commercial situations within the intentions of the GATT drafters.Jaemin Lee argues that both ‘essential security interest’ and ‘emergency in international relations’ are sufficiently wide to encompass non-military and commercial or economic circumstances; however, the mere reference or highlighting of economic harm does not suffice.27 As historian Paul Kennedy stated:“[T]he definition of national security cannot refer simply to military policies or to military spending alone. I think it ought to refer instead to those sources, those underpinnings of long-term national strength in the state and power of our manufacturing, investment in science and technology, of educational skills, all of which ultimately the Armed Forces and defence policy of this country have to rest upon”.28The only condition is that there must be an appropriate, economic justification behind the essential security interest.29 In a case involving Sweden, many Contracting Parties were unconvinced with the Swedish contention that imports of footwear threatened national defence because Sweden did not provide any detailed economic justification.30 In contrast, as the American notion of national security has historically been connected with maintaining a powerful national economy,31 the present case is unlikely to be considered inadequately justified or too remote. High tariffs commanded strong support in the US political history and were used during the Great Depression for strengthening the national economic security and industrial strength for national defence.32 The US has also maintained consistent efforts in incorporating exemptions from their agreements due to economic circumstances, for instance in the Friendship Commerce and Navigation Treaties (FCN treaties). The treaty allows for derogating from national treatment obligations in a period of economic emergency.33  These historical precedents once again illuminate the intertwinement of domestic economic health and national security, and explain why economic circumstances can and should fall within the ambit of ‘essential security interests’ for the US.Accordingly, even if the  Panel remains unconvinced about a country’s chosen matter constituting a national security interest, the selection of national interests is the sole discretion of a country and would not be amenable to WTO review if it has been adequately articulated. As mentioned above, the stated interest could range from government employee benefits, effective transportation of imports and exports or development of nuclear forces.34  Thus, not only is it possible for an economic interest to be used discretionarily to constitute an essential security interest, but the current case of US-China also demonstrates the economic importance and relation of steel and aluminium imports to its essential security interest.B) Belief in The Measure AdoptedThe second aspect of the legal test involves ensuring a link between the measure adopted and the essential security interest. While the test of necessity of the measure is the exclusive assessment of a Member State, the Panel may investigate and ensure that the trade measure was taken with the sole rationale of promoting the essential interest. That said, Article XXI(b) requires adequate explanation which can be subject for review by the Panel only to observe if there is sufficient support of the measure being genuinely considered to promote the essential security interest. The test is thus reduced to a looser, good faith obligation.35  In the case of the US, it would have to demonstrate that the tariffs do not have an ‘implausible’ relation with protecting the essential security interest of national defence and provide adequate reasoning to satisfy the necessity qualification.36As Article XXI did not specify a formal condition to satisfy the legal test and only a minimum requirement should be needed for showing connection between the measure and security interest,37  the US is unlikely to face challenges in fulfilling the lenient standard of review. The Proclamations on the introduction of steel and aluminium tariffs expressed the instrumental role played by steel and aluminium and its value for military and infrastructural purposes, which demonstrate the nation’s belief in the effectiveness of tariffs in achieving their national security interest.38  One may argue that the imposition of tariffs was not done out of genuine belief that it was required for national defence, as the Department of Defence acknowledged that only  3% of total domestic production of steel and aluminium is needed for military purposes and that there is no current shortage of this supply.39  However, because the WTO relies on Member cooperation and reciprocal trust, the concerns expressed in the White House proclamations could successfully fulfil the low good faith threshold. Furthermore, the Panel’s finding in the Russia-Ukraine dispute that the Russian action was a measure genuinely taken for national security interests is in favour of finding the same for the US.  In that case, Russia had taken trade-restrictive measures which resulted in Ukraine not being able to use roads or railways, which prevented the flow of goods to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and affected the goods destined for Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.40  In light of the significant impact on its trade, Ukraine complained about the violation of the GATT treaty and the Russian Accession Protocol. However, Russia did not specifically respond to the legal arguments or factual basis for Ukraine’s complaints related to the GATT treaty nor the Russia Accession Protocol violations. In its submissions, it plainly stated that the measures were considered ‘necessary for essential security interests’ in relation to the 2014 emergency concerning the security of the Ukraine-Russia border.41Despite such little engagement with the allegations and the absence of a full defence on the Russian part, the Panel found that “Russia’s articulation of its essential security interests is minimally satisfactory”. Ultimately, the question was phrased as asking whether the measure was “so remote from, or unrelated to, the 2014 emergency that it is implausible that Russia implemented them for the protection of its essential security interest”.42 On that formulation, only the most distanced and remote links between the measure and essential interest would be rejected. This indicates that even making public suggestions of enacting measures for protectionist interests would not jeopardise the country from meeting the low threshold.43 Thus, even a counterargument that Trump made public statements highlighting that the tariffs on China were for non-essential security reasons would fail to damage the US assertion of good faith belief in the measure. The low threshold would lead to US trade measures being considered as genuinely intended for facilitating national industries.  C) 'Emergency in International Relations'The final determination that Panel must make is to decide whether one of the conditions within subparagraph (b) exist, the most relevant of which for present purposes is the state of emergency in international relations. Lacking an official definition, ‘emergency in international relations’ is one of the vaguest phrases in the article and has been interpreted in ordinary language and meaning in the context of the phrase “war or other emergency in international relations”. As ‘war’ has been referred to as a “violent struggle through the application of armed force”,44 the meaning of ‘emergency’ must be different to ‘war’ and need not reach the gravity of an armed military conflict or else the distinction would be futile. Nevertheless, an emergency must be sufficiently serious to ensure that every state that cannot demonstrate an armed conflict, does not simply rely on the phrase, ‘emergency’, to justify trade measures in a context of mild frictions.45 The Panel in the Russia-Ukraine dispute defined an emergency in international relations as a “situation of armed conflict, or of a latent armed conflict, or of heightened tension or crisis, or of general instability engulfing or surrounding a state”.46 Due to the political and military tensions after the Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014, the Panel was satisfied that the measures taken by Russia were during an emergency period, which gave rise to security concerns for the Ukraine-Russia border. Moreover, the UN General Assembly’s recognition of the armed conflict and absence of evidence suggesting an intention to circumvent WTO trade rules led the Panel to conclude that the minimum requirements for Article XXI(b) had been met.47Although ‘heightened tension or crisis’ could equate to a non-military and economic emergency, the US economic relations with China are unlikely to satisfy the ‘emergency’ requirement. In general, an economic situation, which albeit is not war but threatens causing comparable damage is capable of falling under the scope of ‘emergency’.48 In fact, the use of the conjunction ‘or’ between ‘war’ and ‘emergency in international relations’ indicates that non-war emergencies can be equally harmful to domestic interests, especially in light of economic retaliation and cyber attacks.49 Therefore, it appears that non-military circumstances could validly constitute ‘emergencies’ if they reach a similar level of threat.   However, based on a comparable case, the US would be unable to prove the gravity of the US-China trade war and would, therefore, fail in proving an ‘emergency’.In the arbitration proceedings of CMS against Argentina at ICSID, the emergency defence of a bilateral agreement was invoked by Argentina to justify its actions. However, even though the Argentinian economy suffered through a major economic and political crisis since the 1990s, to the extent that it enacted new laws declaring a public emergency, the tribunal found that Argentina did not meet the benchmark of ‘total’ economic collapse.50 Although the ICSID tribunals are not binding on the WTO, the ICSID interpretation of ‘emergency’ makes for an interesting and potentially useful comparison, especially because WTO has no jurisprudence of its own on this matter. Not only is the US economic situation far less precarious than the Argentinian, but the tension between the US and China remains mainly that of political and economic differences, which as per the Panel report on Russia and Ukraine is insufficient alone for showing an emergency. As the US-China trade war is not of extreme severity and section 232 was intended as an overall economic policy tool51 instead of specifically aimed at national economic security reasons, the US-tariffs are unlikely to be considered as having arisen in an emergency context. Therefore, the US invocation of the national security exception of Article XXI is unlikely to succeed.           III) Outcome of the DisputeAlthough the foregoing analysis implies that the US would have breached WTO laws and cannot make use of the national security exception, this may not necessarily lead to a WTO finding that there has been a breach. If the dispute results in a Panel decision, it could be a ‘lose-lose’ choice. On the one hand, if the Panel lowers the threshold required for an ‘emergency in international relations’ or for other reasons finds that the US could successfully apply Article XXI’s exception, the leniency could encourage other nations to implement trade barriers under the mask of ‘essential security interest’. Not only would this damage the credibility of the WTO as a neutral institution, but it would also render the trade laws that prohibit trade restrictions nugatory. On the other hand, a Panel ruling that finds against the use of the national security justification for the US would be perceived as encroaching upon national decisions and could lead to crucial players, such as the US, withdrawing their membership from the institution.52 It would also risk antagonising the US further, which already refused the replacements for the leaving members of the Appellate Body. This would mean that, unless the US began approving members, the Appellate Body would be paralysed in its functioning as it requires a minimum of three panellists and, without replacements, soon there may only be two panellists remaining.Due to the unfavourable consequences of having a direct confrontation through a Panel decision, it is likely that dispute resolution is reached through diplomatic or non-confrontational means, such as the position US-Nicaragua dispute ended in. In this dispute in 1985, the US effectuated a full trade embargo on exports and imports that went to or originated from Nicaragua. Nicaragua claimed that the US had violated various articles of GATT and that the national security exception could not be used arbitrarily in a context where it was challenging to believe that a country as economically and physically small as Nicaragua posed a real threat to US essential interests.53 Although a Panel report was issued, there was no consensus and the report was ultimately not adopted. Nevertheless, the trade embargo and all sanctions were officially lifted in 1990 when US officials stated that the circumstances that created the need for the trade restriction had dissipated.54 The US-China and US-Nicaragua dispute share similarities in both being cases where an essential non-military interest was at stake, an extreme trade measure was adopted and the context did not represent a true ‘emergency of international relations’. Given these commonalities, it is possible that a diplomatic or political solution may be the only acceptable outcome for the US-China dispute.   IV) ConclusionOverall it seems that invoking the national security exception involves a delicate balance between restricting Members from acting in protectionist manners while being permissive of deviations under the narrow condition of an endangered essential security interest. If the dispute reached the WTO Panel, the US’s use of the defence would be subject to extensive review. The essential security interest of national defence is likely to be satisfied due to Member State discretion in this field and the link between steel and aluminium and national defence. Demonstrating genuine belief in the tariffs being able to achieve a stronger national defence system would also be easily fulfilled, albeit after being subject to review, due to the low threshold. It is the final determination of whether an emergency in international relations exists which would be a blow to the US reliance on the national security exception, as this necessitates grave circumstances in the US-China trade war and the state of affairs has not yet reached that severity.The handling of the US-China trade dispute highlights the weaknesses of the WTO as an institution that relies on consensus and requires the cooperation of key economic leaders in order to be effective. Thus far, the Panel decisions, or the lack thereof, have given rise to more questions than answers, such as the degree to which the Panel will continue with almost ground-level good faith requirement where a nation gives mixed indications of its true rationale behind trade restrictions. Moreover, the application of the vague definitions of ‘emergency’ will remain largely opaque until there is further jurisprudence on Article XXI. Perhaps the clearest lesson on analysing literature and applying the Russia-Ukraine ruling to the US-China tariffs is that discussions of Article XXI(b) have only commenced and require examination in various contexts before its true shape becomes workable or clear. Suffice it to say that the national security exception is no longer a trump card.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("Introduction:In the case of R(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor,1 the Supreme Court ruled that the Lord Chancellor’s Fee Orders for the Employment Tribunal (ET) and the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) were unlawful because they limited access to justice. This article will first set out the background facts and context behind the appeal. Then, it will highlight the shift in focus away from EU law to the common law in the Supreme Court judgment (“Judgment”). Finally, it will analyse the Judgment and discuss the common law’s potential to protect basic rights.  Background facts:Section 42(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (‘2007 Act’) provides that the Lord Chancellor ‘may by order prescribe fees payable in respect of anything dealt with by the First-tier and Upper Tribunals or by an added tribunal.’2 An “added tribunal” is defined by Section 42(3) as a tribunal specified in an order made by the Lord Chancellor.3 In 2013, through an order, the ET and EAT were included as added tribunals.In July 2013, the Lord Chancellor introduced the Fee Order to make provisions for fees to be payable in respect of any claim presented to the ET and EAT. Before the Fee Order was made, access to the ETs, unlike claims in the ordinary courts, could be presented for free. The amount payable varied depending on the type of claim presented and whether it was brought by a single claimant or a group. The two types of claims are split up into “type A” and “type B” respectively. Type A claims require little to no pre-hearing work and are easy and quick to resolve. Meanwhile, type B claims generally involve more judicial time, for example equal pay claims and unfair dismissal claims. As established by the order, the fees for a single claimant was £390 for a “type A” claim and £1,200 for a “type B” claim. In the EAT, fees of £1,600 are payable. Claimants and appellants could only seek remission of fees after satisfying two criteria. First, their disposable capital must be below a specified amount. Second, if this test was satisfied, then the amount of any remission was qualified by the applicant’s gross monthly income. The threshold for access to remission varied depending on certain factors, for example: whether the claimant is single and whether they have children. The only other exception for remission was if the Lord Chancellor was satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances which justified such deviation.UNISON sought judicial review over the Fee Order scheme on the basis that it unlawfully prevented or restricted access to justice. The claim was first brought on the grounds that the Fee Order was indirectly discriminatory and breached the EU law principles of effectiveness and equivalence.4 The Divisional Court dismissed the claim on the basis that the proceedings were premature and lacked sufficient evidence to sustain the challenge.5 The Court of Appeal dismissed the judgment on the grounds that the imposition of a fee would not constitute an interference with the right of effective access to a tribunal under EU law unless it made it impossible in practice to access the tribunal.6 UNISON then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court.A shift in focus:Before discussing the judgment, it is important to point out the shift in focus which the argument took as it proceeded from the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Before the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal, the issue of the Fee Order’s effect on access to justice was challenged on the basis of EU law. Before the Supreme Court, although some reference was made to EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, it was recognized that as part of the UK’s common law constitution, there was a right of access to justice. The shift in focus from EU law to common law in UNISON is an ample reminder that even with rights guaranteed from EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights, the common law remains a source of constitutional rights. When the Human Rights Act was first introduced, the sole focus from the judiciary on the European Convention on Human Rights compromised the common law’s development and ‘left it in the cupboard.’7 Only recently have judges brought back the common law as a guarantor of basic rights. As Lord Reed illustrated in Osborn v Parole Board, which concerned the right to a fair hearing,one should not ‘suppose that because an issue falls within the ambit of a Convention guarantee, it follows that the legal analysis of the problem should begin and end with Strasbourg case law.’8 The focus by the Court on the common law was likely deliberate. The Judgment was handed down after the UK voted to leave the European Union and amid political hostility towards the European Convention on Human Rights. It is in this context that the Judgment illuminates the common law’s potential as a guarantor of basic rights.The Supreme Court’s judgment:In order to determine the extent of the power conferred on the Lord Chancellor by the 2007 Act, the court must consider both the text of the provision and the constitutional principles that underlie the text. Lord Reed noted that there are two important principles in this case to determine whether the Fee Order was unlawful under English law. First, the constitutional right of access to justice. Second, the rule that ‘specific statutory rights are not to be cut down by subordinate legislation passed under the vires of a different Act.’9In English law, the right of access to the courts has been established since Magna Carta: ‘We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.’10 Applied to modern contexts, there are many examples where the judiciary has recognized the constitutional right of access to the courts, which can only be curtailed by clear statutory enactment by Parliament. As Lord Diplock remarked in Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd, ‘the due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access to the constitutionally established courts of criminal or civil jurisdiction for the determination of disputes as to their legal rights and liabilities.’11 In accordance with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, access to the courts should only be impeded through primary legislation from Parliament.In principle, as Lord Reed noted, it can be justified for the executive to impose fees upon litigants. The imposition of fees is desirable because it transfers away costs from the general taxpayer to those that use the system. Moreover, a price mechanism could incentivise settlement and prevent weak claims from being pursued. However, in the context of the 2007 Act, Parliament did not expressly authorise the prevention of access to the relevant employment tribunals. As such, the fees imposed can only be justified if they do not lead to a real risk that persons will effectively be prevented from having access to justice. The court held that the present fee order imposed by the Lord Chancellor was not justifiable for five reasons. First, the Review Report on the impact of the fee orders concluded that the imposition of fees resulted in a ‘sharp, substantial and sustained fall in the volume of cases.’12 Second, the court was not comforted by the presence of the Lord Chancellor’s discretionary power of remission or by the statutory scheme. The effects of the Fee Order had occurred despite the existence of both remission avenues. The problems identified through the report and in the proceedings indicated a systemic issue.13 Third, for low to middle income households to meet the expenses, they would need to sacrifice ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time.14 Fourth, many claims brought in front of the ETs do not seek any financial award. The claims which do seek a financial award are generally quite modest, for example £500 for unlawful deduction of wages. If a litigant had to pay £390 in order to pursue a claim worth £500, they would only sensibly do so if they were virtually certain of success. In practice, there is never a guarantee of success when pursuing a claim. Thus, the onerous fees would ‘render it futile or irrational to bring a claim.’15 The evidence before the court suggested that only half of the claimants who succeeded in obtaining an award received payment in full, and around a third received nothing.16 Finally, the Lord Chancellor did not set the prices at an optimal level to maximize revenue and failed to consider the public benefits derived from the enforcement of rights before the Employment Tribunals.17 All of the reasons above led to the conclusion that the Fee Orders effectively prevented access to justice and was therefore unlawful. Given that the Fee Order was unlawful under domestic law, the other arguments presented were dealt with very briefly in the judgment. Discussion:On doctrinal grounds, the Judgment was reached using well-established common law principles of judicial review. The Supreme Court merely applied the test established in Hillingdon: whether the Fee Order was ultra vires depended on whether there was a ‘real risk’ that litigants would effectively be prevented from having access to the court.18 When reviewing this judgment, it must be emphasised that in UNISON the primary legislation contained no words authorizing the prevention of access to justice. However, Lord Reed, relying on the cases of Leech19 and Daly,20 also suggested in obiter that even where primary legislation was concerned, the imposition of an intrusion on the right of access to justice is subject to a presumed implied limitation: the intrusion ‘must not be greater than is justified by the objectives which the measure is intended to serve.’21 If this limitation was applied to primary legislation, it would appear to be a radical step in well-established principles of judicial review. As suggested by Murkens, ‘the real test would be if Parliament re-enacted the tribunal fees as an Act of Parliament.’22 In UNISON, Leech and Daly, the judicial review challenge was not against primary legislation, but orders and rules made by the executive. Therefore, the three judicial review challenges relied upon well-established principles of judicial review against the executive. However, if the implied limitation is used in practice concerning primary legislation by Parliament, the courts would be embarking on an unprecedented step against the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. The judgment should be applauded for the robust defence of access to the courts in maintaining the rule of law. Access to the courts is important for the rule of law because ‘without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade.’23 The truth is that access to courts and tribunals are not just of value to individual litigants, but also to society. Every decision made by courts and tribunals contributes to the establishment of legal principles that applies to everyone. The courts and tribunals across the UK represent an avenue for litigants to enforce their rights. If a party or business fails to meet their obligation, a litigant should be able to seek a remedy against them. This ability to hold the other party to account is particularly important for relationships that are inherently unequal, such as the employer-employee relationship. In the context of employment tribunals, the mere fact that a claim can be brought by an employee will ensure that employers respect the rights provided by Parliament. If onerous fees prevent employees from making claims, employers could potentially disregard rights knowing that they will not be held to account before a court or tribunal.   Finally, the judgement demonstrates clearly the potential of the common law to protect the right of access to justice, but what about other rights? The first difficulty encountered by the common law as a guarantor of basic rights is that it lacks an established list of constitutional rights. Although, extra-judicially, Lord Cooke included among the list of common law rights: the right of access to a court and to confidential legal advice, the right to a fair trial, the right to equal treatment, and the freedoms of expression and religion;24 as illustrated by Masterman and Wheatle, there ‘remains no complete list of rights which the common law ranks as constitutional.’25 In addition, there are some fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights that are missing from Lord Cooke’s list of common law rights.  The right to private and family life provided by Article 8 and the right to freedom of assembly and association provided by Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights are notably absent among others. The weakness of domestic judicial review in protecting rights was noted by the European Court of Human Rights in Smith and Grady v UK. In the context of Article 8, despite the ‘anxious scrutiny’ test being applied where fundamental rights were concerned, the European Court of Human Rights still felt that the threshold for the domestic approach was so high that it was unable to provide adequate protection.26 Although UNISON demonstrates that the common law can be an adequate guarantor of the right to access of justice, it is important to note that the right being protected in UNISON has a long history of receiving strong judicial protection. Therefore, the impact of the judgment in highlighting the common law’s ability to protect all rights should not be overstated. It is regrettable that the Court did not comment on the common law’s standard of review for other fundamental rights.As a result, the common law’s ability to guarantee other rights, particularly those less well-established, remains precarious. Whether the common law can adapt and evolve to protect other rights currently recognized under the Convention will be thrust into the spotlight if the UK departs from the European Convention on Human Rights in the future.  Conclusion:The judgment in UNISON clearly displays the potential for the common law as an instrument to protect basic rights. In this aspect, it continues the narrative driven by the Court in Osborn27 and Kennedy,28 which highlighted the common law’s protection of the right to a fair hearing and the principle of open justice. In UNISON, the Supreme Court offered a robust defence of the importance of access to justice. However, the judgment leaves open two important questions. First, whether implied limitations apply to primary legislation made by Parliament. Second, despite the Supreme Court demonstrating that the common law will go to lengths to uphold the right of access to justice, it leaves open for discussion whether the common law can also be a powerful defender of other rights.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("IntroductionIn the recent decision of Singularis Holdings Limited (in liq) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd,1 the Supreme Court affirmed a bank’s liability to a corporate customer for the misappropriation of funds by one of the customer’s directors for the first time. In order to contextualise the case this article will first examine the origin of this duty of care. Then, it will explain the reasoning adopted by the Court, before finally offering some views on the impact of this decision on the banking industry generally.  It concludes that although it is the first decision to impose liability on a bank for a breach of the Quincecare duty of care, it is unlikely to affect pre-existing robust banking practices to a great extent, nor to open the floodgates in practice.The Quincecare duty of careIt is a fundamental principle of banking law that “the primary duty of a paying bank is to honour its customer’s instructions and make payments as instructed in accordance with its mandate”.2 This important principle ensures that there are no undue delays for customers accessing their bank funds.However, such a blanket rule has its drawbacks. Under this rule, if a rogue director of a company dishonestly gives the bank instructions to transfer money out of the company’s account, then the bank must do so, even if it would cause the company significant harm. To protect the interests of bank customers and third parties, the courts have developed an additional principle to safeguard against this form of fraud which imposes a reasonable standard of care on banks.3 This principle—known as the Quincecare duty of care—arose out of a case involving a bank which had lent money to a corporate borrower. The funds were paid into the corporate borrower’s account, but the chairman of the company subsequently requested the bank to transfer a large portion of the borrowed funds to the account of a firm of solicitors that had acted for him on a previous occasion. However, those solicitors were not acting for the company at the time, but rather, were assisting the chairman to transfer all the funds away to the United States. The bank then sued the guarantor of the loan for repayment of the loan.In the course of determining whether the guarantor had any defences against the bank’s claim, Lord Steyn set out the following principle in relation to whether the bank in fact owed a duty of care to the corporate borrower not to pay out the money on the chairman’s instructions:4“A banker must refrain from executing an order if and for as long as the banker is ‘put on inquiry’ in the sense that he has reasonable grounds (although not necessarily proof) for believing that the order is an attempt to misappropriate the funds of the company … And, the external standard of the likely perception of an ordinary prudent banker is the governing one.”On the facts of the case, the defence failed on the basis that the bank’s conduct did not meet the threshold.The Quincecare principle appears to strike a reasonable balance between allowing the bank to process genuine transactions efficiently, and imposing some limit on the bank’s ability to do so where something is amiss. A bank is entitled to start from the assumption that a transaction is genuine and valid and that its customer is honest, and would only need to question a transaction when there is reason to do so. Examples of such circumstances include where ‘any reasonable cashier would hesitate to pay a cheque at once and refer it to his or her superior, and when any reasonable superior would hesitate to authorise payment without inquiry’;5 or where there is a ‘serious or real possibility albeit not amounting to a probability that its customer might be defrauded’.6However, until recently, no case against a bank for breach of its Quincecare duty of care has succeeded.  For example, in Lipkin Gorman, the bank manager knew that the partner of a law firm had a gambling problem, but still allowed that partner to empty the firm’s bank account using cheques that were only signed by that partner. Even in those circumstances, the Court ruled that imposing liability would impose a “wholly unrealistic duty” on banks to continually monitor for signs that a corporate customer’s signatory might be abusing his signing powers.7 Accordingly, it is clear that the realities of the sheer volume of banking transactions weigh so strongly on a Court’s mind that it would only be in truly exceptional circumstances that the Court would impose liability. This gives banks a certain level of comfort that the duty of care does not require constant monitoring of all of its customers’ accounts for potentially fraudulent activity.Background to SingularisIt is in this context that the recent Supreme Court case of Singularis is of interest, being the first case to impose liability for a breach of the bank’s Quincecare duty of care.Singularis Holdings Limited was a company set up to manage the personal assets of Mr Al Sanea. Mr Al Sanea was Singularis’s sole shareholder, as well as a director and chairman. In this role, Mr Al Sanea had signing powers over the company’s bank accounts. Singularis entered into an arrangement with an investment bank called Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited. As a result of this arrangement, Daiwa eventually held a cash surplus in the account of Singularis of US$204 million. In the meantime, the bank became aware that Mr Al Sanea was in dire financial straits, with his assets having been frozen by the Saudi authorities. Within approximately a month, Mr Al Sanea gave instructions on behalf of Singularis to make eight payments totalling US$204 million to Saad Specialist Hospital Company and Saad Air, even though there was no proper basis for any of those transactions. Daiwa duly honoured those instructions without further investigation, and paid out all the money from Singularis’s account – effectively allowing Mr Al Sanea to misappropriate those funds.Mr Al Sanea then put the company into voluntary liquidation. In order to recover funds to be distributed to creditors in Singularis’s liquidation, the liquidators brought a claim against Daiwa for recovery of the amounts of the payments, based on Daiwa’s breach of the Quincecare duty of care owed to Singularis by giving effect to Mr Al Sanea’s payment instructions.The High Court ruled that in the circumstances, there was a clear breach of the Quincecare duty of care.  In doing so, it took into account the following factors:(a) Mr Al Sanea was using the funds for his own purposes and not for the purposes of benefiting Singularis;8(b) The bank was aware of Mr Al Sanea’s and Singularis’s dire financial straits;9(c) The bank was aware that Singularis might have other substantial creditors with an interest in the money;10(d) The bank was put on notice that there were significant issues with the way that Mr Al Sanea was operating the Singularis account;11(e) The bank was aware of the possibility that there was a front or a cover rather than a genuine obligation in relation to some transactions;12 and(f) There was a striking contrast between the processing of different payments, with the impugned payments often being simply signed off without consultation or discussion with anyone.13Based on the above factors, the Court concluded that there was a breach because:“Everyone recognised that the account needed to be closely monitored … But no one in fact exercised care or caution or monitored the account themselves and no one checked that anyone else was actually doing any exercising or monitoring either.” 14Daiwa appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and then to the Supreme Court. Daiwa accepted the finding that on its face, there had been a breach of the Quincecare duty of care. However, it relevantly argued that it had a defence to the claim—namely that Mr Al Sanea was Singularis’s directing mind and will, and that therefore, his fraud can be attributed to Singularis. Daiwa’s argument was that if Singularis was implicated in the fraud, then the claim against Daiwa is defeated by illegality, lack of causation, or because of an equal or opposite claim for the company’s deceit against Daiwa.15Supreme Court’s rulingThe Supreme Court traversed a number of previous authorities regarding attribution of a fraudulent director’s knowledge to a company.  These included:(a) Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission, where the House of Lords identified three levels of attribution: firstly, the express rules of attribution in the company’s constitution; secondly, the rules of agency and vicarious liability; and finally, if neither of these apply, based on the construction of the particular rule in relation to which attribution is required;16(b) Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens, where the Court ruled that the fraudulent activities of the beneficial owner and directing mind and will of the company were to be attributed to the company;17(c) Bilta (UK) Ltd v Nazir (No 2), which limited Stone &amp; Rolls to its facts, and has been interpreted as meaning that the dishonesty of the controlling mind in a one man company could be attributed to the company.18Ultimately, the Supreme Court did not specifically decide which of these three cases governed the situation here. Rather, it ruled that the guiding principle for attributing a director’s fraudulent knowledge to a company is always to be found in consideration of the context and the purpose for which the attribution is relevant.19 In this case, the context to be considered is the Quincecare duty of care. The purpose of this duty is to protect the company against the misappropriation of funds by a trusted agent of the company who is authorised to withdraw its money from the account – that is, the very sort of misappropriation that occurred here. If in these circumstances, the fraud of the trusted agent is attributed to the company, then in practice, the Quincecare duty would be rendered redundant. Stepping back, the Supreme Court also recognised the reality that “companies are different from individuals. They have their own legal existence and personality separate from that of any of the individuals who own or run them. The shareholders own the company. They do not own its assets and a sole shareholder can steal from his own company.”20 Accordingly, there is no reason in principle that a director’s intentions must always be attributed to the company, and this determination is highly dependent on context.Because of its conclusion on attribution, the Supreme Court did not consider further arguments regarding illegality, causation or deceit.What is the impact of this decision on banks?Since the Quincecare duty of care has existed for some 25 years without any successful cases ever having been brought against a bank, some may have considered it to be a theoretical duty since the threshold for breach is so high that it would never have any practical application. Thus, some consternation may be caused by the Supreme Court’s findings that not only could the Quincecare duty found liability against a bank, but also that a fraudulent director’s state of mind could not be attributed to the company for the purposes of this duty. There may be the view that if the courts will now impose such liability, it could cause further cases to be brought and open the floodgates. Indeed, banks may understandably query whether it is just to impose liability on the bank for the acts of a fraudulent director, given that it is the failure of the company’s corporate governance processes that has created the situation in the first place. Should the company not pay for its own failures, or seek recovery from the fraudulent director instead?However, the result reached in the case can be justified.  First, on the point of attribution, there is some artificiality in saying that the director’s fraudulent intentions should be attributed to the company when it is the company that is being defrauded. The Supreme Court’s decision simply acknowledges the reality that the intent of fraudulent directors who act outside the scope of their duties no longer act as the company.Further, from a policy perspective, as this case illustrates, often companies are unable to protect their own assets against the managing director who has control over all of its affairs—indeed, that is the very nature of one-person companies. In such circumstances, the banks who have close dealings with such a director are perhaps in the best position to assess any suspicious circumstances giving rise to a transaction, and to prevent them from occurring, rather than accepting the signatory’s suspicious actions at face value. Given that this duty and its protective purpose have now become settled law, it follows that it would be antithetical to this purpose to allow the bank to plead the defence that the rogue director’s fraud should be attributed to the company.In any event, it would be too simplistic to conclude that it is the company that would suffer the ultimate harm from the fraud if the bank is not liable. In the case of one-person companies, it is often to one director’s advantage to transfer all the funds out of the company, leaving the company as an empty shell. The company, being an empty shell, has nothing to lose—the parties that lose out are any existing creditors that would otherwise have been paid out in a liquidation. Indeed, in this case, it was Singularis’s liquidation that led to the claim being brought against the bank. In circumstances of liquidation, it is often the case that either the director can no longer be located, or even if located, he or she no longer has any assets worth pursuing. When the situation effectively becomes a choice of balancing the interests of a bank that had some power to prevent such loss, and the interests of creditors who had no power to do so, it is not surprising that the balance might be struck against the bank.Furthermore, although liability was imposed in this case, it must be remembered that generally, the courts continue to require exceptional circumstances before imposing such liability. The Quincecare duty is not so exacting that it requires banks to scrutinise every transaction to look for suspicious activity, but rather it only arises where the situation has become so obvious to the bank in its day-to-day transactions that any reasonable bank would make further inquiries. In practice, this is not very different from other existing duties that banks are required to comply with, such as reporting suspicious activity under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017. It simply requires banks to have in place procedures that would allow a rogue signatory’s fraud to be treated as suspicious activity and inquired into further procedures that one would expect to already be in place.Accordingly, although Singularis is the first decision ever to impose liability for a breach of the Quincecare duty of care, it is the author’s opinion that it is a sound decision that merely affirms that banks must take care when honouring its customer’s mandate in situations that raise suspicions as to the signatory’s true authority. It is unlikely in practice to affect pre-existing robust banking practices to a great extent, nor to open the floodgates.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("Abstract:1The English Law on “medical manslaughter”, manifested through the common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter, may be broadly defined as the defendant’s grossly negligent act  or omission, when acting within the terms of their duty of care, which results in the victim’s death. With the current crisis facing the NHS, prosecution of medical practitioners for medical negligence is growing in prominence as a controversial issue, one of which commentators and medical professionals alike are critical of. In the recent case of R v Bawa-Garba (‘Bawa-Garba’), these criticisms of the current regime concerning gross medical negligence have reached the breaking point. Following a controversial High Court conviction of an NHS junior doctor of gross negligence manslaughter, the Court of Appeal’s refusal the doctor’s leave to appeal sparked a public debate on both legal and political grounds. This case note will begin by providing an account of the Bawa-Garba case. Furthermore, it will consider the problems with the arbitrary standard of gross negligence in the offence of gross negligence manslaughter, and potential incompatibilities with Article 7 of the Human Rights Act (1998). Following that, the legal issues in establishing causation will be examined in light of complications created by existing systemic issues of the NHS, eliciting concern for the “blame culture”2 in the medical profession. Lastly, the argument that the legal uncertainty in this area warrants the re-assessment of the case and the law will be advanced.Part I: Case DigestKey facts3A junior doctor, Dr Bawa-Garba applied for permission to appeal against her jury conviction for gross negligence manslaughter for the death of Jack Adcock, a six-year-old boy with Down’s syndrome. In the Crown Court, the jury found Dr Bawa-Garba guilty by a majority of 10 to 2. She was initially sentenced to 24 months imprisonment and suspended for 24 months. Her application for leave to appeal against the conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in December 2016.Dr Bawa-Garba was the most senior junior doctor on duty at the time when the victim was admitted to the hospital. Jack Adcock was initially treated for acute gastro-enteritis and dehydration and subsequently pneumonia after an x-ray had been taken. The reality was that upon admission to the hospital, the victim’s pneumonia had caused him to go into septic shock, resulting in heart failure. Efforts to resuscitate him were to no avail.The prosecution’s case was that Dr Bawa-Garba’s serious neglect “had contributed to or caused the boy’s death”, includingfailing to recognise the significance of the victim’s blood test results and to detect sepsis; failing to ask her consultant to review the victim’s condition, and failing to notify Jack’s mother not to administer enalapril (one of the victim’s long-term medications) to Jack, which would precipitously drop blood pressure. The Crown contended that Dr Bawa-Garba’s repeated mistakes over a protracted period amounted to conduct and fell so far below the standard of care expected of a competent professional that it amounted to gross negligence, warranting a criminal conviction.4IssuesOn appeal, the defendant contended that there had been a misdirection of the jury in determining the question of causation. The trial judge (Nicol J) had directed the jury to consider whether the victim had “died significantly sooner”5 due to the defendant’s negligence for the prosecution to prove their case. The defendant averred that the right test would have been for the jury to “be sure that there would have been significant prolongation of Jack’s life”6 had the right treatment been given.Part II: Case Debate(a) The ambiguities of gross negligenceR v Adomako (‘Adomako’),7 the leading authority on gross negligence manslaughter, defined a five-step test for the offence. Firstly, there must have been a duty of care; secondly, that duty must have been breached; thirdly, the defendant’s breach must have caused the victim’s death; fourthly, there must have been an obvious risk of death, and fifthly, the defendant’s conduct must have been grossly negligent enough to warrant a criminal conviction. The case of Bawa-Garba subjects the third and fifth limbs of the test to scrutiny.To begin with, Bawa-Garba highlights the lack of clarity in the law with regards to the threshold requirement for the establishment of gross negligence. Since merely causing or allowing death to occur through negligence will not incur a charge of manslaughter, criminal liability for the offence requires an extreme deviation from a reasonable standard of care. Academics such as Kazarian, Griffifths and Brazier have identified the main issue with English Law on gross negligence manslaughter as the “elusive concept of grossness”.8 Such elusiveness can be seen in the differing legal tests that have been developed following Adomako. The threshold for establishing gross negligence was prescribed in Adomako as a “breach of duty (that was) so bad, so obviously wrong, that, having regard to the risk of death involved in it, it can properly be condemned as criminal”.9 The tone of certitude masks the reality of an ill-defined threshold for gross negligence that fails to adequately distinguish between flagrant negligence and fleeting error.10On principle, the Adomako test has often been criticised to be circular,11 with the level of negligence required to hold the defendant culpable being defined as sufficiently negligent to deserve a criminal conviction for manslaughter.12 Furthermore, the inability of the Adomako test to meet the test of certainty required by Article 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998 was challenged in R v Misra (‘Misra’). Article 7 stipulates that one should not be held guilty for an action that was not a criminal offence when it was committed,13 meaning that clarity on the law is required for doctors to know if their actions are grossly negligent and liable to criminalisation. However, this was quashed in Misra by Lord Justice Judge’s assertion that the question was “not whether the defendant’s negligence was gross, and whether, additionally, it was a crime, but whether his behaviour was grossly negligent and consequently criminal”.14 This clarification, unsatisfactory at best, has been characterised by Horder as a “distinction without difference”,15 exposing just how manifestly undefined the threshold for “gross” conduct remains today. Given that the medical profession is already fraught with unpredictability and precariousness, such added uncertainty evokes great unease with the current state of law.In practice, subsequent case law has departed slightly from this definition. More significantly, differing court interpretations have created a degree of legal uncertainty across different cases, demonstrating the elusive aspect of Kazarian’s observation. While the requirement for negligent conduct to be “gross” was “truly exceptionally bad” in Bawa-Garba, it was defined as “reprehensible conduct” in Misra. The use of judicial epithets for gross negligence reflects what Quick terms the “definitional difficulty” of gross negligence manslaughter in the medical context, with no standardised and objective method of categorising episodes as “gross” or “not gross”.16 Empirical evidence has shown the lack of a clear distinction to create an ambivalent definition, generating “inconsistencies in the verdicts”.17 For Dr Bawa-Garba, the repercussions of this meant that her impeccable track record was instantly invalidated by a momentary blunder made after a twelve-hour understaffed shift. Moreover, the fact that there is no statutory footing for gross negligence manslaughter means that the parameters of the crime are defined through case law developments only, despite the severity of the crime. This is further complicated by the fact that Adomako leaves the jury with a wide discretion to decide whether the accused should be convicted.18 As Lord Mackay’s statement essentially asserts that the jury is deliberating a question of law when deciding whether to convict a defendant.19 Such discretion produces difficulty in predicting jury decisions by creating a margin to make moral decisions. Despite generating a criminal label upon conviction, gross negligence manslaughter remains an issue in flux.(b) Systemic v Individual failuresHowever, the legal uncertainty created by the ambiguous threshold for establishing grossly negligent conduct is but a preface to the wider debate concerning individual failure in relation to systemic failures within the NHS.The defendant’s innocence found rapport in the medical profession’s strong dissent against the court’s judgement. Many felt the charge for gross negligence manslaughter was unjustified in light of the wider systemic failings of the NHS, contending that Dr Bawa-Garba had been scapegoated for the system’s shortcomings, such as chronic understaffing, a faulty IT system, and poor rotational shift planning.20 Dr Bawa-Garba’s personal mistakes were to an extent induced by her pressured situation, and, therefore, should not be separated in assessing her overall culpability.Moreover, failure to factor system problems into the trial process has led to a narrowed scope of understanding causation. By failing to couch individual failures in wider systemic issues, the law on causation has fostered a “blame culture”.21 Such a public reaction can be reasonably construed as reflective of how the law of causation falls short of accounting for the complexities of healthcare. The courtroom dissection of hospital tragedies can and may unfairly attribute the blame to the defendant, failing to consider the unpredictable reality of medical practice particularly within the context of NHS burgeoning problem of overstretched resources.22As Anthony Harvey contends, individual acts of negligence are often identifiable as the product of some larger collective process.23 If it is accepted that criminal responsibility should not start and end with the doctor on trial, then perhaps a widening of the individualistic paradigm currently adopted by the judiciary should follow.(c) Causation and culpabilityTo what extent, if any, should context be factored into the legal issue of establishing causation remains contentious and unclear. In Bawa-Garba, it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove causation by showing that death “occurred significantly sooner”24 when the necessary treatment was not administered, despite it being unclear if the right treatment would have saved the victim’s life. The fact that the victim died significantly sooner due to the defendant’s negligence was held to be an “inescapable corollary”25 of certainty that “competent treatment would have saved or significantly prolonged life”,26 effectively quashing the defendant’s leave to appeal.There has been difficulty in the law in definitively apportioning the extent to which causation is a question of law rather than a question of fact. Theorists such as Brudner27 consider the fairness of imputing the consequence on the defendant, whereas others such as Moore28 would argue that causation should be decided independently of culpability. Such a polarised opinion on whether causation is ultimately a question of fact or law has compromised on the coherence of the law’s approach to causation. Given the complex factual matrix of Bawa-Garba and the nuances typical of the medical environment, it lends credence to Herring’s argument that it is simply impossible for any guiding rules on causation to be established.29 Rather, the judge simply considers the common-sense answer to the question of causation and declares that to be the legal position.30Another key issue with this approach is that it focusses on causal attribution of individual blame, arguably failing to adequately consider the contextual concerns of the case. At the time of the tragedy, Dr Bawa-Garba’s circumstances were clearly fraught with system pressures, including a twelve-hour double-shift during which she was the only junior doctor present, and an IT failure that delayed the victim’s blood test results for six hours.31 These circumstantial factors, having caused Dr Bawa-Garba’s mistakes, were not sufficiently considered. Given that the offence of gross negligence manslaughter seeks to assess individual culpability, such systemic failings were only considered to be “of peripheral relevance”32 to the trial, and only taken as mitigating factors during the sentencing stage.Donaldson postulates that “avoidable harm is at its most contentious when the focus is on accountability”.33 By demanding individual accountability, the judicial approach taken to causation seeks to apportion blame to the prosecuted individual in a vulnerable position. The scope for determining causation is narrowed down to the actions of the individual being judged in the courtroom, rather than a holistic consideration of systemic failures. Unfortunately, this seemed to be the case in Bawa-Garba. In response to the case, the Minister of Health ordered an official review of medical manslaughter prosecutions attempting to ensure that “systemic issues and human factors” are taken into account, suggesting that the frame for identifying causation has to be reworked.Concluding thoughtsIn conclusion, this case highlights the incompatibility of criminal justice system with the complex nature of healthcare, illustrating the limits of criminal law in administering justice in the field of medical error. Bawa-Garba evidences that the problem with the law on gross negligence manslaughter lies in its inherent state of unclarity in the areas of causation establishment and the threshold for grossly negligent treatment. Inaccuracies remain both in principle and in practice given the systemic failings of the NHS. As such, this case should have been successfully appealed, and the conviction for manslaughter quashed. The defendant was a victim in her own right, having been ensnared by the ambiguity in the present law on gross negligence manslaughter. Reforms are much needed to rectify the implications of such uncertainty on personal accountability. In determining the issue of gross negligence and causation, failure to consider the realities of practice and systemic failings has created a highly unfair situation, where the weight of one systemic disaster has fallen onto the shoulders of a single doctor as a personal catastrophe.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)

                var time = Math.ceil("R v. Evans: An Uneasy Precedent?In this piece, I discuss the recent case of R v Evans, in which the Court of Appeal allowed the defence to adduce evidence regarding the complainants’ sexual history with third parties in the context of a rape trial. I will assess the academic debate surrounding the controversy the case brought through the expansion of s 41(3)(c) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 to allow such evidence to be adduced. As such expansion has been criticised on the basis that it has created a tension between the complainant’s right to privacy and the defendant’s right to a fair trial, I will outline the criticism of Evans by various academics, addressing whether these criticisms are sound, and put forward my ideas regarding how the problems of Evans can be resolved (i.e. through a cultural change, as opposed to legislative change). This work was initially inspired by LSE’s Law of Evidence class content. I declare that this work has not been submitted elsewhere.In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving victims of sexual offences speaking out. It appears therefore timely to review the current law of evidence in this specific context. In particular, the current law concerning sexual history evidence (SHE) has been criticised on the basis that the ruling in R v Evans1 extends the law too far such that it imbalances the trial by working to the detriment of the complainant, particularly her right to privacy. Indeed, there has been a sense that Evans has led to a regression in the law. The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was implemented to protect complainants and prevent against the so-called ‘double myth’, however, with Evans as precedent, their protections have been put at risk and the ‘double myth’ has returned.Firstly, this article will outline the law on SHE and will give a brief overview of the Evans case. Then, it will assess whether the law needs reform, drawing on academic debate. Finally, this article will discuss the current proposals for reform and will put forth its own reform idea. In summary, this article strongly argues that the current SHE regime works to the detriment of the complainant in some instances, however, this is due to a misapplication of the law rather than a problem with the law itself. To reform the law and make it more restrictive would work to the detriment of the defendant and his right to a fair trial. Thus, instead of reforming the law, a cultural change is needed regarding the public perception of sexual offences and gender roles. This cultural change would alleviate issues such as deterring victims and victim-blaming. More importantly, this reform option would not compromise either the right of the defendant or the complainant.Understanding the current lawThe admissibility of SHE is governed by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. According to s 41, there is a general ban on the admission of SHE so that the defence is not allowed to ask questions in cross-examination or adduce evidence of the complainant’s sexual behaviour. Sexual behaviour is defined under s 42(1)(c) as meaning previous sexual encounters with the defendant or any other person. In some instances, however, the court may grant leave to the defence to adduce SHE contained in s 41(3)(a), (b) and (c). Per s 41(3)(a), a court may grant leave if SHE is relevant to an issue other than the issue of consent. Other issues include: whether the defendant had a reasonable belief in consent,2 whether the offence was fabricated, or whether there is a false identity issue. Meanwhile, s 41(3)(b) allows the defence to adduce evidence where there is evidence of sexual behaviour ‘at or about the same time’ as the offence. In the case of R v A, ‘at or about the same time’ was defined in dicta as being constrained to twenty-four hours.3 Finally, s 41(3)(c) provides that evidence of sexual behaviour may be adduced where it is ‘so similar’ to any sexual behaviour the complainant engaged in with the defendant or which took place at the same place/time. This was seen in R v T4 where it was held that the fact that the complainant had engaged in sexual behaviour previously with the defendant at the same place made it more likely she consented.However, these exceptions found within s 41(3) are subject to further restrictions. First, the evidence must relate to ‘specific instances’ of sexual behaviour5; second, a refusal of leave might have the result of rendering an unsafe verdict 6; finally, the purpose must not be to impugn the credibility of the complainant.7Case law has further expanded the instances where SHE may be adduced by the defence and this has been evidenced by both R v A and Evans. In R v A, the House of Lords allowed defence counsel to adduce evidence of SHE between the complainant and defendant to provide the jury with context to make a fully informed decision. Indeed, there were concerns that the current regime prevented the jury from knowing the context and potentially prevented the defendant from putting a defence forward. Thus, the court found that the legislation was too restrictive in this respect. The court went as far as to say that preventing the jury from knowing the context could amount to a violation of the defendant’s right to a fair trial per Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, the court introduced an implied provision based on fairness through their s 3 power of the Human Rights Act (HRA). This provision established that if it is necessary to adduce SHE for fairness then it is admissible.8Meanwhile, in Evans, the court expanded the s 41(3)(c) provision by allowing SHE regarding conduct between the complainant and third parties to be adduced. The context was that the defendant (Evans) was initially found guilty of rape in 2012. The defendant appealed his conviction; new evidence was brought to light concerning two other men. The two men  claimed they had sex with the complainant around the same time as the alleged rape and described their encounters as similar to Evans’ account. Indeed, the Court of Appeal identified the following ‘similar’ elements: the complainant ‘had been drinking’; she ‘instigated certain sexual activity’; she ‘directed her sexual partner into certain positions’ and ‘used specific words of encouragement.’9 This was enough to satisfy s 41(3)(c) and so, the defendant was acquitted. However, some commentators have been particularly critical of these developments, arguing that reform is necessary because (a) the current law tilts the balance too heavily in favour of the defendant at the expense of the complainant’s right to privacy10; and (b) it creates a significant risk that the jury takes irrelevant evidence into account.11Considering the arguments for reformCertain commentators have viewed Evans and R v A as setting an uneasy precedent which effectively deters victims from reporting sexual offences through the fear of cross-examination of their sex life. Indeed, by establishing that sexual behaviour does not have to be ‘bizarre’ or ‘unusual’12 effectively sets a very low bar on the admission of SHE. However, others have read the ruling in a more sympathetic light. Dent and Paul, for instance, disagree with this claim and argue that it is not the law that deters victims from reporting but the media coverage of sexual offences.13 In contrast, McGlynn uses empirical data, like surveys and police records, to highlight that the court process, including admission of SHE, does impact on complainants’ decision-making.14 McGlynn shows that the admissibility of SHE results in many complainants withdrawing their claims for fear of the potential invasion of their privacy and that their sex life may be the subject of the trial, and concludes that there is a need for reform. Indeed, by sacrificing the complainant’s private life, this interpretation of the provision arguably goes against Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence, a ‘legal system that allows extensive examination might one day be contrary to Article 8.’15Some have also argued that the ruling of Evans evidences a need for reform because the current law encourages victim-blaming.16 Arguably, with Evans we see a shift in attention from ‘probative credibility’ to ‘moral credibility’.17 Moral credibility ‘refers to the general ability of a witness to tell the truth.’18 Moral credibility is problematic since it can ‘distract jurors attention from the consideration of rape, directing them towards that of sex’19 and thus lack of consent versus consent. This ‘Madonna-whore complex’ (in which chastity is moral, and so, trustworthy, whereas unchastity is immoral, and so, untrustworthy) finds that ‘women of ill-repute are not to be trusted in their testimony.’20 Indeed, Smart observes in a rape trial the complainant’s previous sexual relations are ‘reconstructed into a standard form of sexual fantasy… in which she becomes the slut who turns men on and indicates her availability through every fibre of her clothing and demeanour’21  and so, during the trial, the body ‘becomes literally saturated with sex.’22  In this respect, SHE ‘risks introducing irrelevant or prejudicial material which may distort rather than promote the fact-finding role of the trial’. 23 Instead, it makes the complainant’s sex life, and behaviours more generally, the subject of the trial. Thus, jurors focus on the ‘respectability’ of women complainants, with evidence of previous sexual activity or any other activity that attracts moral judgement reducing their ‘respectability’ which, in turn, reduces the assessment of credibility. This essentially shifts legal and moral blame from the defendant to the complainant. When considering this point in the context of Evans, the argument concerning moral credibility is particularly persuasive. Evans has been viewed by some as particularly invasive of the complainant’s private life. Baird, in particular, fears that with Evans as a precedent, rape trials could become inquisitions into the complainant’s sex life,24  and within the adversarial trial, these inquisitions can be quite terrifying seeing as the prime tactic is to discredit complainants. Complainants have, therefore, described the task of appearing in court as ‘worse than the rape itself.’25 Evans, in this respect, effectively perpetuates the ‘double myth’ that because a woman consented on one occasion, she is more likely to consent on another. Likewise, it perpetuates the ‘double myth’ in the minds of the jury that because of the complainants’ previous sexual activity, she is morally questionable and so, untruthful. Thus, this type of evidence being adduced may, as Redmayne suggests, result in a prejudicial effect whereby the jury might ‘take a dim view of the complainant.’26  The law on the admissibility of SHE, therefore, needs to be reformed because concerns surrounding the moral credibility of the complainant could result in prejudicial effect against her, which could sway the jury in the defendant’s favour. However, Dent and Paul are critical of the arguments stating that Evans represents a return to the ‘double myth.’  Instead, they highlight that s 41 is a high bar for SHE to be admitted, and that Evans was a very particular case with a particular set of facts, so it is more the exception than the rule.27 Yet, this is not the case. As shown by Evans the threshold is not that high.28 Indeed, in Evans evidence was admitted because in previous sexual encounters, the complainant had been drinking and had used a particular phrase/position. Such commonplace behaviour was considered unusual and this significantly lowers the bar for ‘similarity’. Thus, reform is necessary to overcome issues surrounding moral credibility and prejudicial effect.Finally, commentators such as Redmayne have argued that Evans is problematic in that it assigns probative value to SHE, when such evidence has little probative value.29 Indeed, just because someone consents to someone on one occasion, that does not make it more or less likely that they will consent to that person (or another person) on another occasion.  There ‘is no probative connection between consenting to one person and consent to a different person.’30 Criticisms that Evans has brought to light regarding the perpetuation of the so-called ‘double myth’ has led to increased calls for reform.Proposals for reformThere have been some proposals for reform. For instance, the Harman reform proposed a complete abolition on s 41 exceptions, such that that complainants should never be cross-examined regarding their sex life.31  Commentators such as McGlynn have argued in favour of the Harman reform on the basis that SHE should always be excluded since it is irrelevant.32  They ask: what is the relevance between consenting to one person on one occasion and consenting to another person on another?Yet this article does not favour such a drastic option. Instead, to view SHE as never relevant is equivalent to viewing the offence of rape from the perspective of the complainant only. This is problematic because the law is already too restrictive. It is, as Birch claims, ‘draconian’ and amounts to ‘legislative overkill’ which goes too far against the rights of the defendant.33  Hoyano’s study also revealed that many within the law profession viewed the law as already too restrictive.34 The Canadian court considered an option similar to the Harman reform and concluded that a complete prohibition is inconsistent with the fundamental rights of the defendant to a fair trial.35 Thus, to reform the law in this way would imbalance the law such that the complainant receives too much protection at the expense of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. This can result in ‘miscarriages of justice’36 because to abolish the s 41 exceptions would mean that the jury has no context upon which to base its decision. This could ultimately lead to unsafe convictions, and perhaps more worryingly, it could lead to false convictions. False convictions should be avoided at all costs since they can have ‘deleterious consequences’ which can result in ‘social, psychological and economic damage.’37Instead, this article favours the view that there is no problem with the existing law itself. It has simply been misapplied. Indeed, commentators such as Dent and Paul have attempted to reconcile Evans on the basis that it is a simple application of the law. Dent and Paul claim that due to the similarity between the sexual behaviour of the complainant with the defendant and the complainant with third parties, the case was somewhat analogous to R v T. However, such an argument is unpersuasive because Evans and R v T were not analogous. The case of T concerned SHE between the complainant and the defendant, not the complainant and third parties (like in Evans). Stark’s claims are more persuasive in that the court has ‘misdirected’ its attention to s 41(3)(c) when it should have invoked s 41(2)(b).38 Thus, the law itself does not need to be reformed, but rather attention should be refocused to s 41(2)(b) as opposed to s 41(3)(c). By focusing on s 41(2)(b) as opposed to s 41(3)(c) would mean the complainant won’t have their private life scrutinised as harshly, and so their right to privacy will be upheld.Rather than a change to the existing law, a better option is a cultural change in people’s attitudes. This change would more easily accommodate the current law without compromising either the right of the defendant to a fair trial or the right of the complainant to privacy. Changing the law is unlikely to have a practical impact especially where those applying these rules of evidence have entrenched views on women and how they behave. When SHE is admitted, even where it is relevant, juries will place considerable weight upon it and effectively creates a ‘smokescreen of immorality around the complainer.’39 Rape complainants are therefore judged on the basis that women should be adhering to certain moral standards. Failing these standards means there is a high price to pay in that it is unlikely that the jury will trust their testimony. Public and jury education is necessary for this improvement to take place. This would ensure that unfair acquittals based on stereotypes wouldn’t take place. Where there is a cultural change to people’s attitude on rape, issues such as deterrence and victim-blaming will rarely arise. Whilst  such an option may not seem attainable, with the growing awareness concerning sexual crimes, especially in light of #MeToo, we are arguably seeing this cultural change take place, albeit slowly. In the meantime, the law should follow Stark’s recommendations that greater attention should be redirected towards s 41(2)(b) rather than the similarity gateway. However, for the law to work effectively in the long term, a change in cultural beliefs about women is necessary such that cases like Evans never occur again.To conclude, Evans is certainly a problematic case in that it has expanded the scope of s 41(3)(c) such that SHE is much easier to adduce due to the low bar (not having to be ‘unusual or ‘bizarre’). Yet to reform the law in the complainant’s favour would make the law too restrictive and would come at the expense of the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Although there are certainly persuasive reasons pointing to the need for reform, reform to the law is not necessary. Cultural change combined with a refocusing of the court’s attention to s 41(2)(b) could overcome issues such as victim-blaming and deterrence, without compromising either the defendant’s right to a fair trial or the complainant’s right to privacy.".trim().split(/\s+/).length/250)
