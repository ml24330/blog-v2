<left><img class="sponsor" src="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/cambridge-law-review.png"></left>
<p class="mb-4">The Cambridge Law Review (CLR) is an independent academic journal run by students of the University of Cambridge which aims to provide a forum for the discussion of contemporary and cutting-edge legal issues. We welcome contemporary submissions on issues relating to all common law jurisdictions, or those with a former connection to the English common law; European law; international law; comparative pieces; as well as interdisciplinary legal scholarship that has regard to economics and political studies. We do consider purely jurisprudential or historical pieces on a case-by-case basis. Despite being a journal run by students of English law, we do not evince a preference for submissions relating to English law; our most important criteria for publication is that your submission relates to a contemporary legal issue and provides critical insight into the area of law you have chosen.</p>

<p class="mb-4">De Lege Ferenda (DLF) is the Cambridge Law Review’s supplementary undergraduate law journal, inviting discussion on contemporary issues relating to undergraduate law topics. The journal serves as a platform for students to make their first entry into academia, and all published articles will be made available online. DLF welcomes submissions discussing issues arising in recent cases and legislation. A submission may be written as a standalone piece, or be made in reply to published work. Your opinion on these matters is most important to us. Submissions should address issues such as: whether there will be any significant or noticeable practical impacts caused by a recent legal development; whether the law is changing too quickly or slowly; whether the changes are practically, doctrinally, or normatively sound; amongst numerous other possible issues.</p>
